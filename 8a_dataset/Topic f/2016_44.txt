Abstract
The focus of this investigation is how elementary school librarians are facing the
challenges of changing their school media centers to be mainly based on digital materials
such as e-books. Library resources have increasingly become available in digitalized
form but some school librarians are not acquiring e-books in their collections; currently,
over 44% of school library collections do not include e-books. New media innovation,
such as adoption of e-books for school libraries, involves a constant tension between
determination and contingency, or between order and uncertainty for personnel involved
in the adoption process. The problem is information professionals continue dealing
mostly with printed materials, and many appear challenged with, and resistant to
changing their student media centers to be mainly based on digital materials, especially
on e-books. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how school information
professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books
within their organizations. This exploratory research study used a multiple-case study
research design. The researcher conducted seven in—depth face-to-face individual
interviews with school information professionals at public elementary schools in the state
of New J ersey. The unit of analysis for this study was the library information
professionals in public schools that serve students in grades kindergarten through fifth
grade. Most of the school librarians View e-books as a useful teaching tool, particularly
when features are used. Participants have concerns that features such as narration may
prevent students from actually reading the story or decoding words. Some school
librarians prefer print books over e-books, yet purchased e-books or a subscription to e-

books for their school library collections. Findings reveal that budget cuts are impeding

purchases of digital materials. Several participants mentioned having to maintain print
collections while adding e-books and other digital materials to their collections.
Participants also mentioned lack of enough devices for full classes in the media center or
technology infrastructure issues that prevent the use of devices. While some information
professionals have concerns about cuts in library positions due to adoption of e-books,

others find that using these resources can create a positive impact.

Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my loving husband, Chris for his caring and support during
the process. We have always supported each other as we face mountains. He was
wonderfully supportive throughout this trek. I also want to thank my wonderful son
Christopher and my beautiful daughter-in—law Dana who have provided love and support
and well as three amazing grandchildren, Kacey, Christopher, and Carlo who were able to
take my mind off of my work for a little while when I needed to relax or have a good
laugh. Thanks are also owed to my mother Joan and my sisters, Linda and Cindy as well
as my brother Walt who have made it possible to keep going on this project. Your love
and support have meant so much! None of this would have been possible without my very
supportive mother in law Geri and my late father in law, George who lent us money so I
could go back to school and earn my teaching degree over twenty years ago. That set me
on this path and none of it would have been possible without their help. Many thanks for
support and words of encouragement from my friends and fellow librarians, Michele,
Joan, Alice, Fran, and Amy. Thank you to those who volunteered for my study. This
dissertation could not have been completed without your help. I especially want to thank
my Chair, Dr. Daphne Halkias. She seemed to understand exactly how to keep me going.
Her encouragement as well as her expansive knowledge got me through this very
challenging process. I have learned so much from her. I would also like to thank Dr. Sean
Spear and Dr. Rachel Piferi. As members of my committee, their assistance was very

valuable. Both were diligent and caring mentors as well. Thank you so much to all of you!

Chapter 1: Introduction

The use of digital books also known as electronic books or e-books has increased
dramatically in everyday life since they were created in 1971 when e-books were first
provided through the Internet as a part of Project Gutenberg (Project Gutenberg, 2011).
An e-book is ‘a digital object with textual and/or other content which arises as a result of
integrating the familiar concept of a book with features that can be provided in an
electronic environment’ (Vasileiou & Rowley, 2008: 356). Net Library was established in
the late 1990s to provide e-books to libraries (Ramaiah, 2012). Although e-books have
been around for more than four decades they were not commonly used until Amazon
released the first Kindle in 2007 ; an electronic reading device designed to read e-books
and since that time many other dedicated e-readers have been developed and sold
(Connell, Bayliss, P., & Farmer, 2012). Now many other devices can be used to View e-
books. These devices can be used as e-readers and can also perform many other tasks that
require the use of a computer (Connell et al., 2012). Mobile phone technology has also
advanced to allow users to read e-books on cell phones (DePollo, Tolley-Stokes, &
Sherrod, 2011). The use of digital e-readers has been increasing with 32% of adults
owning a dedicated e-reader and 42% owning a tablet in 2014 (Pew Research Center,

20 14).

Public libraries have been providing access to digital resources that include e-
books from Net Library and Ebrary for decades (Ramaiah, 2012). School libraries also
sometimes known as "school media centers" are part of public schools in the United
States. Students in Kindergarten through 12th grade are served by media centers.

Acquisitions of e-books in school library media center collections have lagged behind

those of public libraries in the number of e-books in their collections (Library Journal,
2013; School Library, 2013). In a School Library Journal survey, school librarians
predicted a 30% increase in e-book circulation for 2013 (School Library, 2013). In a
similar survey of public librarians by Library Journal, a 39% increase in circulation was
predicted for 2013 (Library Journal, 2013). In the same survey 89 % of the public
librarians surveyed predicted that would have an increase in e-book circulation in 2013
(Library Journal, 2013), while 51% of school librarians surveyed expected e-book
circulation to increase in 2013 (School Library, 2013). Thus there is a disparity between
the level of acquisitions of e-books between public libraries and school libraries.

This chapter provides an overview of the rationale for exploring how school
information professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies such as
e-books within their organizations. The research questions that are articulated in this
chapter are followed by a road map of the research methods designed to address the
purpose and significance of the proposed study. Finally, this chapter contains deﬁnitions
of key terms used within the theoretical framework that support the purpose of the

designed study.

Background

The increased popularity of e-books has in turn increased the number of research
studies involving their use and acceptance. E-books have been around for decades so
there are many studies on the use of e-books for providing support for children’s
acquisition of literacy skills (Miller & Warschauer, 2014; Shamir & Korat, 2015) and
more recent studies of e-books for teaching literacy skills have investigated the use of e-

books on devices such as iPads and Kindles (Miller & Warschauer, 2014). There are a

number of studies about the acceptance of e-books by university students (Elias, Phillips;
& Luechtefeld, 2012; Sieche, Krey; & Bastiaens, 2013) and university faculty (Elias et
al.; 2012; Shrimplin; Revelle; Hurst, & Messner; 2011). There are also a few studies that
focus on acceptance of e-books by Library Information Science (LIS) students (Aharony,
2013; Aharony 2014b); and library information professionals (Aharony; 2015). There
appears to be a paucity of research in the area of school librarians adoption of e-books in
today’s US school libraries.

One of the greatest changes in the role of the school librarian brought on by
digital resources is in how the school librarian and the school library serve the school
(Kimmel; Dickinson; & Doll; 2012). Instead of storing all materials at the school library;
users can access the digital resources from anywhere and the school librarian assists users
by linking them with the resources they need (Kimmel et al.; 2012). Digitalized books
provide students with opportunities to read more books on demand and also provide easy
access to online digital tools (Wright, Fugett; & Caputa, 2013). E-books have been found
to assist the learning of literacy skills for young children, struggling readers; and those
who are learning a new language (Korat; 2010; Lin; 2010; Moody; 2010; Moody; Justice,
& Cabell; 2010; Shamir & Shlafer; 2011).

School library professionals serve as information gatekeepers within the organi-
zations (Aharony 2014b). Dotson and Jones (2011) found that in spite of the need for
school librarians to undertake a leadership role in technology; over two-thirds of the
school librarians they surveyed tended to prefer to take on traditional roles within their
schools. Many school librarians hold positions that require the use of digital resources

and do not receive preparation in their coursework while in school to handle these

materials (Laskowski, 2010). They need to be educated on the ways that digital resources
such as e-books can provide access to learning materials that meet the needs of students,
including those with disabilities (Subramaniam, OXley; & Kodama; 2013). Often school
librarians ﬁnd themselves learning the skills they need while servicing their patrons
(Laskow ski; 2010).

Many information professionals have accepted library materials that come in both
digital and print forms. More recently they have increasingly had to decide whether it is
in the best interest of their patrons to focus on developing exclusively digital collections
(Aharony; 2015). This means that they must not only adjust to the changes in the way
patrons interact with reading materials but also in the way they provide service to
patrons. Users must access e-book ﬁles through devices such as laptops; tablets dedicated
e-readers and Smartphones that allow users to access them from anywhere (FelVegi &
Matthew; 2012). These devices were designed for pleasure reading so they may not fit
with all the types of reading done for academic purposes (Brown; 2012).

Additionally; digitalized materials come with business models that are very
different than print materials (Bhattacharjee et al.; 2011). According to RonceVic (2013b)
there are four areas for librarians to take into account when acquiring e-books for library
collections: content; technical specifications; functionality; and business model. When
compared to print books; there is a lack of uniformity in the features that are available in
e-books and this is not expected to change in the future (Zucker, Moody; & McKenna;
2009). The many choices are causing school librarians to face many challenges in
learning how to purchase e-books because the business models offered are very different

and more complicated than when purchasing print materials. Librarians making

purchases must take time and care to purchase what is needed for their patrons
(RonceVic; 2013b).

To date; many information professionals have become used to dealing with
printed materials as well as with digital ones, but now they face a situation in which more
and more materials are digitized and they must decide whether they want the information
organizations where they work to be mainly based on digital materials; especially on e-
books (Aharony, 2015). Information professionals should understand that e-books
represent change, and challenge the business models for libraries and information
services as well as creating behavioral changes; for readers (Bhattacharj ee et al.; 2011).
Statement of the Problem

Library resources have increasingly become available in digitalized form
(Aharony, 2015) but some school librarians are not acquiring e-books in their collections;
currently; over 44% of school library collections do not include e-books (School Library;
2013). New media innovation, such as adoption of e-books for school libraries, involves a
constant tension between determination and contingency; or between order and
uncertainty (Lievrouw, 2012) for personnel involved in the adoption process. School
librarians in exemplary schools serve as “change agents,” for their schools by introducing
new resources and have the potential to lead members of their school community to adopt
innovations (Lee & Klinger; 2011. National educational standards require students to use
digital resources in Mathematics and Language Arts (Common Core State Standards
Initiative; 2012).

The increased use of e-books has pushed instructional uses for e-books into the

limelight; and use of e-books has been linked to improved student learning (Shamir &

Shlafer, 2011; Wright, Fugett, & Caputa, 2013). While some pre-serVice school librarians
consider the use of e-books as a threat to the profession; (Aharony, 2013) there is an
increasing need for school librarians to acquire digital resources and to initiate
collaborations with teachers to provide instruction to students on their use (Cooper &
Bray; 2011). There is an expectation that those who are library information professionals
will be early adopters of technology or will remain unable to update their information
services to serve today’s student and staff information needs. (Aharony; 2014b).
Additionally; there is a need to study this topic in various contexts and through the use of
qualitative methods (Aharony, 2015). The problem is information professionals continue
dealing mostly with printed materials, and many appear challenged and resistant in
changing their student media centers to be mainly based on digital materials, especially
on e-books (Aharony 2015; 2014b).
Purpose of the Study

The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how school information
professionals perceived the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books
within their organizations. To satisfy the goal of this exploratory research, a multiple-case
study research design was used and data was collected through multiple sources (Yin,
2014). The researcher conducted eight in-depth face-to-face individual interviews with
school information professionals at public elementary schools in the state of New Jersey.
The unit of analysis for this study was the library information professionals in public
schools that serve students in grades kindergarten through fifth grade. Qualitative data
was based on insights derived from in-depth interviews (Patton; 2002). Since the study

concentrated on a specific segment of the information sector instead of an eclectic

sampling, data collection was achieved with a purposeful sample using a snowball and
chain sampling strategy (Yin; 2014). Data was also collected through the maintenance of
field notes (Katz; 2014), archival documentation and subj ect matter expert examination
of and reﬂections on the data (Patton; 2002). Triangulation of data sources was conducted
to establish credibility of the researcher’s analysis on the phenomena under study (Yin;
20 14).
Research Questions

The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how school information
professionals perceived the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books
within their organizations. This research could provide school administrators with
significant information to develop strategies for overcoming challenges facing their
information professionals in faculty obstacles adopting new technologies; such e-books,
in their organizations. Data from participant interviews was analyzed to understand
emergent concepts; linkages, and meanings based on participant responses (Yin; 2014).
To obtain the appropriate answer, the right questions needed to be asked (Browne &
Keeley; 2007). As such, it became important to identify suitable questions for the
research. In line with the purpose of this study, the research questions follow:

RQ1: How do school information professionals perceive adopting new
technologies such as e-books within their organizations?

RQ2: How do school information professionals perceive their personal challenges

in the adoption of new technologies such as e-books within their organizations?

RQ3: How do school information professionals perceive the organizational
barriers that challenge their adoption of new technologies such as e-books within their
organizations?

Nature of the Study

Library resources have increasingly become available in digitalized form
(Aharony, 2015) but some school librarians are not acquiring e-books in their collections;
currently; over 44% of school library collections do not include e-books (School Library;
2013). New media innovation, such as adoption of e-books for school libraries, involves a
constant tension between determination and contingency; or between order and
uncertainty (Lievrouw; 2012; p. 4) for personnel involved in the adoption process. School
librarians in exemplary schools serve as “change agents” for their schools by introducing
new resources and have the potential to lead members of their school community to adopt
innovations (Lee & Klinger; 2011).

The increased use of e-books has pushed instructional uses for e-books into the
limelight; and use of e-books has been linked to improved student learning (Shamir &
Shlafer, 2011; Wright, Fugett, & Caputa, 2013). While some pre-serVice school librarians
consider the use of e-books as a threat to the profession; (Aharony, 2013) there is an
increasing need for school librarians to acquire digital resources and to initiate
collaborations with teachers to provide instruction to students on their use (Cooper &
Bray; 2011). Additionally; there is a need to study this topic in various contexts and
through the use of qualitative methods (Aharony, 2015). The problem is information

professionals continue dealing mostly with printed materials, and many appear

challenged and resistant in changing their student media centers to be mainly based on
digital materials; especially on e-books (Aharony 2015; 2014b).

The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how school information
professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books
within their organizations. To satisfy the goal of this exploratory research, a multiple-case
study research design was used and data was collected through multiple sources;
therefore research design for this investigation was a multiple-case study. The focus of
the investigation was how school librarians are facing the challenges of changing their
school media centers to be mainly based on digital materials such as e-books (Aharony
2014a; Aharony; 2014b). A multiple-case study complemented the results of studies that
had already been conducted by other researchers using quantitative methods (Yin; 2014;
Aharony; 2015). A multiple-case study allowed for comparing and contrasting the cases
to see parallels and divergences in how the individual school librarians and their
organizations dealt with digital resources in school media centers (Baxter & Jack, 2008).
In opting for this method; consideration was given to the type of research questions that
were developed. According to Yin (2014) case studies are an appropriate choice for
studies with research questions that seek to explore how or why. Additionally; the topic
for this investigation was focused on events that were contemporary rather than historical
so case study was an appropriate choice for this investigation (Y in; 2014).

The units of analysis for this study were 8 school information professionals who
work in K-5 school media centers in the state of New Jersey. The researcher’s goal in
choosing the study’s sampling strategy was to intentionally select participants according

to the needs of the study. Therefore; purposive sampling was used in this research to

10

ensure participants were representative of varied geographic areas and media center size.
This study was designed as a multiple-case study in order to understand complex social
phenomena in the absence of controls needed for strong quantitative research (Yin,
2014). Multiple-case designs have distinct advantages and disadvantages in comparison
to single-case designs. The evidence from multiple-cases is often considered more
compelling; and the overall study was therefore regarded as being more robust (Herriott
& Firestone, 1983). A multiple-case study of organizational climate may involve
individual employees as a subunit of study (Yin, 2014). When the data focus is only on
individual employees in a multiple-case study, the study becomes an employee; and not
an organizational. study as in the present research where the original phenomenon of
interest; the decision-making process for school librarians when considering e-books in
the school media center collection; was the context and not the target of study (Eisenhardt
& Graebner; 2007; Yin; 2014). The unit of analysis was library professionals who work
in school media centers that serve students in kindergarten through ﬁfth grade. The
qualitative research method was chosen for this study because of the depth of
understanding that this approach can provide for the researcher. Qualitative research
seeks to understand the world or a particular setting from the perspectives of the people
living in it. This design enabled the researcher to explore differences within and between
cases (Yin; 2014).

Data for the main study was collected by the researcher through individual; in-
depth interviews. The goal of the data collection process was to focus on exploring how
school information professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies

such as e-books, within their organizations. Thematic analysis was used to perform the

11

content analysis of interview data for this study. The analytic technique used on the data
is the cross-case synthesis so that each individual case was treated as a separate case, but
synthesis of the data of each case strengthens the overall case study data. Research data
was collected in individual cases and compared to determine consistency and variance
between cases (Yin, 2014). Data was also collected through the maintenance of field
notes (Katz; 2014), archival documentation and subject matter expert examination of and
reﬂections on the data (Patton; 2002). Triangulation of data sources was conducted to
establish credibility of the researcher’s analysis on the phenomena under study (Y in,
20 14).
Significance of the Study

This study is significant because it provides insights to school administrators;
colleges and universities, professional organizations; and vendors; about school
librarians’ perceptions of adopting e-books in their School Media Centers collections.
Acquisitions of e-books in school library media center collections have lagged behind
those of public libraries in the number of e-books in their collections (Library Journal;
2013; School Library; 2013). In a School Library Journal survey, school librarians
predicted a 30% increase in e-book circulation for 2013 (School Library; 2013). In the
same survey 89 % of the public librarians surveyed predicted that would have an increase
in e-book circulation in 2013 (Library Journal; 2013; while 51% of school librarians
surveyed expected e-book circulation to increase in 2013 (School Library; 2013). Thus
there is a disparity between the level of acquisitions of e-books between public libraries

and school libraries.

12

School librarians have identified support and leadership from district
administrators particularly school principals; as an enabler for librarians to practice
technology integration leadership (Johnston; 2012b). Thus providing insights from school
librarians on their perceptions of integrating e-books into library collections will assist
administrators better supporting them. School librarians have also identified professional
library organizations such as American Library Association (ALA) and American
Association of School Librarians (AASL), as providers of professional development and
conferences as well as connections and support from peers to bridge skill gaps (Johnston;
2012b). Providing information to professional organizations on school librarians’
perceptions of integrating e-books in the school library collections will provide
information on the professional development and other support needed to assist with the
challenges school librarians face.

The results from this investigation can inform university and colleges that have
Library Information Science (LIS) programs about the needs that school librarian have to
incorporate digital resources in the school library collection. Often school librarians must
learn the skills required for their position while on the job (Deissler; Ding; Neumann, &
Kopcha; 2015). With all the changes in the role of school librarians, universities have had
to make changes to their educational programs to better address these changes (Cooper,
2015). This study can provide information to those developing programs for LIS to better
prepare them for incorporating digital resources in school library collections.
Additionally; there are many studies that discuss the need for school librarians to be
leaders in the integration of technology in their schools yet there is little research on the

role of school librarians (Johnston; 2012a). There is a need to interview school librarians

13

to determine what factors are barriers or enablers to their role as technology integration
leader (Johnston; 2012b) this can include developing digital school library collections.

Summary

The use of digital books increased dramatically after Amazon released the Kindle,
an e-book reader in 2007 (Connell et al.; 2012). Many different devices including cell
phones can be used to access and read e-books (Depollo et al. 2011). Acquisitions of e-
books in school library media centers have lagged behind public libraries in the number
of books in their collections (Library Journal; 2013; School Library; 2013). There have
been many studies that have found that e-books support literacy learning for young
children; struggling readers; and those learning a new language (Korat; 2010; Lin; 2010;

Moody; 2010; Moody; et al.; 2010; Shamir & Shlafer; 2011).

15

School library professionals serve as information gatekeepers within the
organizations (Aharony; 2014b). Many information professionals have accepted library
materials that come in both digital and print formats but more recently; they have had to
decide on developing collections that are fully digital (Aharony; 2015). Information
professionals must adjust to changes in the way patrons interact with materials and the
way they provide services to their patrons. Business models for purchasing e-books are
very different than business models for print materials; which adds to the challenges
information professionals face (RonceVic; 2013b).

Some school librarians are not acquiring e-books in their school media center
collections (School Library; 2013). Librarians are expected to be “change agents” (Lee &
Klinger; 2011). Information professionals are expected to be early adopters of technology
(Aharony, 2014b). There is a need to study this topic in various contexts and through the
use of qualitative methods (Aharony, 2015). The problem is that information
professionals continue dealing mostly with printed materials, and many appear
challenged and resistant in changing their student media centers to be mainly based on
digital materials; especially on e-books (Aharony 2014a; Aharony; 2014b).

The purpose of this study is to explore how school information professionals
perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books within their
organizations. An exploratory research, a multiple-case-study research design will be
used and data will be collected through multiple sources (Yin; 2014).

This study is significant because it provides insights into the perceptions of
information professionals that work at K-5 schools toward including e-books in their

school media center collections. The information provided in this study will assist school

16

administrators; colleges and universities, and professional organizations with significant
information to assist school library information professionals for overcoming challenges

they face in adopting new technologies.

Chapter 2: Review of the Literature

E-books and e-readers are increasingly used throughout the world. This new
delivery format for reading material has seen sales increased over 36% for child and
young adult e-books as reported by the Association of American Publishers (AAP)
Statshot (Milliot, 2015). As more individuals purchase e-books and e-readers; greater
demand is being placed on libraries to provide these resources (Duncan; 2010) but adding
E-books to school libraries is only one part of the equation. Students must be taught the
digital literacy skills to access and use them effectively (Johnston; 2012b). In addition
school librarians must have the knowledge to make choices about which digital resources
are appropriate for their schools (RonceVic; 2013a). This is a major change from the way
that school library services have been provided in the past. School librarians need to be
able to take a leadership role in the use of technology in their schools (Dotson & Jones,
2011). The purpose of this literature reView is to explore research in the areas of: The
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM); e-books for school libraries, e-books and student
learning, the role of the school librarian; professional development for librarians,
collection development for school libraries, and formats of e-books.
Documentation

The process of locating research to support this study explores how school
information professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies such as
e-books within their organizations required the use of several resources: Northcentral
University (NCU) library databases; Google Scholar; and references from selected
studies. EBSCOhost; Science Direct and Sage Journals, were particularly useful for this

literature reView. Google Scholar was used to find articles that could be located through

18

the databases listed above. Key search terms that were used included: digital book, @-
book; electronic book, school library, media center, catalog, digital learning;
elementary school, technology acceptance mode, and TAM.

Technology Acceptance Model

TAM was developed by Davis (1989) to investigate the willingness or
unwillingness of users to accept technology through two factors, perceived usefulness
(PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) (Davis, 1989). TAM was one of the earliest
models to suggest the importance of psychological factors in inﬂuencing the acceptance
of technology (Teo; 2013) and has been cited thousands of times by other researchers
(Hess, McNab; & Basoglu, 2014). TAM was inﬂuenced by the Theory of Reasoned
Action developed by Fishbein and Azjen It is a theory that espouses that behavior is
inﬂuenced by an individual’s attitudes; intentions to do a behavior; and the individual’s
beliefs about the behavior (Aharony; 2014b).

Over the last several decades TAM has been used to investigate the intention to
use technology for many different groups and varied situations (Teo; 2013). TAM has
been validated by many research studies over that last few decades (Kelly; 2014) and has
been used to investigate the acceptance of many different technology innovations
including e-books (Sieche; Krey; & Bastiaens, 2013).

TAM has also been used to investigate Library and Information Science (LIS)
students’ and information professionals’ acceptance of many different types of
technology innovations by including the intention to use e-books (Aharony, 2013).
Aharony (2013) conducted an exploratory analysis of Library Information Science

students’ perceptions of e-books. The researcher used three different questionnaires,

19

personal information; perceptions of e-books assimilation in the library, and another
about cognitive appraisal that dealt with participants’ coping skills. There were 800 L18
students at the university and a professional school for those in the library field. The
researchers sent 200 online surveys and 50 surveys by mail to students at both schools
and received responses from 144. There was a significant difference between the
perceptions of those at the professional college and university with those at the
professional school believing that patrons’ attitudes and expectations will be changed by
the assimilation of e-books into library collections. Participants from the professional
library school also felt more threatened by the assimilation of e-books into library
collections. Age was also found to be an important factor because the older the
participant the more likely the participant felt assimilation of e-books would be a
challenge and the more it would affect library patron attitudes. It was also found that the
more positively participants felt about e-book assimilation, the less they felt threatened.
The study provides background history on e-books and provides insights into the
perceptions of LIS students and students at professional schools toward e-books.
Aharony (2015) conducted an empirical study of 169 information professionals in
Israel using TAM and factors such as motivation; personal innovativeness; and cognitive
appraisal for the investigation. Two groups were studied; information professionals and
librarians. The link to the survey was sent to two discussion boards, one that serves
librarians and another that serves information professionals. PEOU and PU were
supported by the study as determinant for behavioral intention to use e-books with PU
being the strongest. This could mean that if information professionals are conVinced that

e-books are useful they may be more willing to accept them. It was also found that those

20

participants who self-described themselves as “innovative” were more likely to accept e-
books. The study also found that those information professionals that felt threatened by e-
books were less likely to use them. Personal innovativeness; motivation, and threat vs.
challenge were also important for participants’ intention to use e-books.

TAM was also used to investigate LIS students and librarians’ acceptance of
mobile libraries (Aharony; 2014a). Aharony (2014b) investigated the differences between
information professionals’ and LIS students’ intentions to use e-books. The TAM was
used in this investigation. One hundred sixty-nine information professionals consisting
mainly of academic and public librarians participated through a link to a survey on a
discussion group for information professionals. LIS students were recruited through Visits
to library school classrooms for those studying to be public; academic, and school
librarians. The participants from the LIS group numbered 132. Questionnaires were
diVided into five sections: Demographics, computer skills; motivation; intention to use e-
books; and cognitive appraisal. The LIS students scored higher in computer skills; which
was predicted by researchers. The information professionals were found to be more
motivated to accept e-books than LIS students, a finding that was contrary to researchers’
predictions. The LIS students and information professionals were similar in their
acceptance of e-books but the information professionals saw acceptance of e-books as
more of a challenge than LIS students. PEOU and PU, the determinants of TAM were
found to be good predictors of intention to use e-books in both groups with PU being
stronger as a predictor for both groups. LIS students were more accepting of e-books than

information professionals. This study provides background information about

21

information professionals’ intentions to use e-books and provides another example of
TAM in studying information professionals such as school librarians.

Researchers have extended TAM by adding over 40 different constructs and
others have combined TAM with other research models such as the task technology fit
model (Aharony; 2015; Sieche, et al.; 2013). Aharony (2014a) has added the constructs of
motivation and cognitive appraisal to TAM while investigating the factors that affect the
adoption of e-books by information professionals. Others have added the constmct of
emotional attachment to print books to TAM when investigating the acceptance of e-book
readers (Sieche et al.; 2013). Sieche, Krey; and Bastiaens (2013) investigated students’
usage and acceptance of e-books at a large German university. The participants in this
study included 57 students. Over 90% of the participants were female. TAM was used;
but other factors were also included to expand TAM. One factor was emotional
attachment to print books. The others were Technology Readiness and prior knowledge
of e-books. The results supported PEOU and PU as determinants. Attachment to print
books was found to impact acceptance of e-books. In terms of prior knowledge; survey
questions about e-books available at the university showed that many students did not
know how to access them. The more knowledge students had about e-books, the more
responses tended to be more positive about them. Those who reported being technology
ready were also more positive toward e-books.

TAM is not without criticism. Bagozzi (2007) had previously collaborated with
Davis on several TAM investigations and even conducted some without DaVis. He has
related that although TAM has been used in over 700 investigations; that the simplicity of

the model does not fully explain intention to use technology.

E-books for School Libraries

There are many different forms of e-books today but originally e-books were
books in the public domain from Proj ect Gutenberg that were available from the Internet
(Gray & Copeland, 2012). Michael Hart be gan digitalizing books and other literary items
and providing access beginning in 1971 (Lebert; 2010). E-books in the public domain
continue to be available for adults as well as children through Project Gutenberg and
other sites. These e-books are available on the Internet and are free but can be difficult
for children to use because some of the sites that host the books are not designed to meet
the developmental needs of children (Martens; 2012). As e-books increased in use some
early versions were sold as interactive books on CD-ROMs with supplemental materials
such as Videos but interest in these e-books fell off in popularity in the mid 1990s
(Manley & Holley, 2012) although some interactive e-books for children on CD-ROM
continue to be used in some early childhood classrooms (Salman; 2013).

E-book formats have continued to evolve as technological innovations have made
them possible. Most e-books are available as ﬁles that can be downloaded by users to
deVices providing portability. Users must access e-book files through deVices such as
laptops; tablets dedicated e-readers and Smartphones that allow users to access them from
anywhere (FelVegi & Matthew; 2012). These deVices were designed for pleasure reading
so they may not be suitable for all types of reading executed for academic purposes
(Brown; 2012).

E-books purchased for children can be multimodal e-books. These books can
include narrations; Videos, images, hotspots, music; sounds, and more. Some of these

features can enhance student learning but others can be distracting (Bus; Takacs, &

23

Kegel; 2015). When purchasing these books it is important to know whether the features
can be turned off. For example; some e-books have music or sound in the background
during the narration of the story. For some students, particularly those with learning
challenges this is distracting and can impede learning (Bus; Takacs, & Kegel; 2015).

More recently users have many choices about the language used in the narration
of e-books. These “dual-language” e-books provide text in more than one language and
can even be accessed on sites that provide free or for purchase e-books for children
(Turgut & Tuncer, 2011). Some dual-language e-books have even been designed to
provide support in e-books for deaf students through American Sign Language (ASL)
(Stone; 2014). Another change in the way books are used is the extension of the book to
include links to social media or online games that expand beyond the text of the book.
This can also be accomplished through the creation of apps that users download to access
more information about the story; solve a mystery; or communicate about the content of
the book (Martens; 2012).

A School Library Journal survey of school librarians in United States found that
only 20% of elementary and middle school staff and students had access to at least 100 e-
books. The percentage increased to one third for high schools (Farmer; 2011). One reason
for this is that digital collection development decisions have become more complicated
due to the increasing choices of e-book platforms (RonceVic; 2013b). School librarians in
charge of acquiring digital materials must decide on the best platform for their school
library. These decisions involve choosing to purchase directly from a publisher, an
aggregator that provides digital content; which offers materials from more than one

publisher, or from a distributor that sells materials from both (RonceVic; 2013a). After

24

choosing the platform; a school librarian has other considerations that must be made
before purchasing e-books, and there are resources available to assist them (RonceVic;
2013c). The many choices are causing school librarians to face many challenges in
learning how to purchase e-books because the business models offered are very different
and more complicated than when purchasing print materials. Librarians making
purchases must take time and care to purchase what is needed for their patrons
(RonceVic; 2013b).

According to RonceVic (2013b) there are four areas for librarians to take into
account when acquiring e-books for library collections: content; technical speciﬁcations;
functionality; and business model. When compared to print books; there is a lack of
uniformity in the features that are available in e-books and this is not expected to change
in the future (Zucker, Moody; & McKenna; 2009). The content in e-books often includes
interactive features such as narrations; links to more information about a topic; or
multimedia enhancements (RonceVic; 2013b).

Technical specifications of e-books are important because they determine what
types of deVices and software are needed to access the e-books (RonceVic; 2013b). E-
books can be created in hypertext markup language (HTML); portable document format
(PDF); or created for a specific hand-held deVice (Ramaiah; 2012). The most commonly
used file formats for e-books in libraries are EPub or PDF files (RonceVic; 2013b). There
are many different deVices that have been designed to read e-books exclusively and
others that are able to do much more. Some of these deVices can be used to read only
certain files so this must be taken into account when dealing with e-books (Ramaiah;

2012). School librarians should be aware of the way students will be connecting to use e-

25

books. There are a large number of individuals who use mobile technology to connect to
the Internet. This is particularly true for those who are less afﬂuent or non-white (Cohron,
2015) so it is important to take these factors into consideration when making purchases.

Functionality of e-books concerns the extras that are added to e-books that
enhance the use of the books. This includes specialized features such as dictionaries,
keyword searches, but also information provided in reports on e-books usage (RonceVic;
2013b). Some newer features allow readers to interact socially by linking to social
networks at specific areas within the books (Ribiere, Picault, & Squedin, 2010).

E-books acquired for school libraries are packaged in many different ways. The
way they are packaged is called a business model (RonceVic; 2013b). It is also important
to for school librarians to be aware that e-books can come in the form of digitalized
versions of print books which maintain much of the characteristics of the original books
or they can be born e-books which are books originally created as e-books (Aharony,

20 13 ).

There are many ways that e-books can be packaged. Some e-books are sold as
subscriptions for set periods of time, other e-books become a permanent part of the
library collection; and some e-books are sold as packages that based on the number of
patrons with access to the materials (Sathyanarayana, 2013). There are also rules for how
e-books can be used; for example printing part of the e-book may not be permitted.
Another consideration is whether the e-book is purchased as a one copy license or
unlimited access that allows for many users to access a book at one time (RonceVic;
2013b). School librarians must know what is permissible under the licensing agreements

so they can serve their patrons ethically and still gain all the benefits to which their

26

library patrons are entitled (Reinsfelder; 2014). Additionally; e-books must be located for
patrons to use them. The means of locating e-books is called “discovery” (Breeding;
2014). New trends in discovery involve one stop searches that can incorporate databases,
e-books, Videos and other items into one search product similar to the interfaces used in
commercial searches such as Amazon.com or Google which display covers or images of
items (Chickering & Yang; 2014). These web-based discovery tools first became
available in 2007 through OCLC WorldCat Local with several other products debuting in
2010 (Chickering & Yang; 2014). With all items available to patrons in one place; users
have quick and easy use of the available library materials whether they are stored locally
on servers or web-based (Chickering & Yang; 2014). These discovery products make
searching for library materials easier and that is necessary for patrons to use them.
E-books and Student Learning

There are many educational uses for e-books and e-readers for students of all
ages. Children have developmental needs and these should be taken into consideration
when designing digital resources for children (Martens; 2012a). There are also different
skills required for reading digital books. Tasks like page turning are accomplished
differently in digital books than print books (FelVegi & Matthew; 2012).

E-readers are becoming increasingly popular; but they are not without ﬂaws.
Some popular e-readers have similar readability ratings as a print book and can
accommodate user’s needs by adjusting font size; and have supportive features such as
narration; illustrations, and the ability to find the meanings of words; which can assist
beginning readers in acquiring literacy skills (Korat; 2010). Pairing text with narration or

images that relate to the text can support readers because one part of the brain works with

27

text and another with images, this dual-channeling aids in learning text or in processing
images (Bus; Takacs; & Kegel; 2015). However; it is important to note that these same
features can become distracting to children and inexperienced readers as well (Moody;
2010). Cognitive overload can occur when extra images or text that do not relate to the
text in the book; are added to multimedia stories. When readers try to interact with the
unrelated information it can impede readers from comprehending the story. This is
particularly true for children because their brains are still developing and they are not yet
able judge which information is relevant, a form of multitasking (Bus; Takacs, & Kegel;
20 15).

There are also differences in navigating e-books that could cause using them for
academic purposes to be more challenging than when using print materials (Siegenthaler
& Groner, 2010). In any case, use of e-readers and e-books in literacy instruction are a
recent development, so the long-term impact remains to be seen (Moody; 2010).

Children spend over seven hours online per day so they are already exposed to
digital text but often this time is spent on social networking and reading text on web sites.
School librarians can provide access to digital resources such as e-books so students can
spend some of their online time reading (Agosto; 2012). E-books can be used in the same
way as print books. For example traditional student book clubs can be adapted to use e-
readers such as the Kindle (Harland et al.; 2010). Some students prefer e-books over print
books; particularly when they can use features such as adding notes. The added features
in e-books challenge educators to find ways to use them for the benefit of students
(Larson; 2010). Larson (2010) conducted a case study in a classroom of 17 students. Two

students were chosen for the focus of the study due to their “diverse reading levels and

28

ethnic/linguistic backgrounds” (Larson; 2010; p. 17). Students in the class used Kindle E-
readers to read stories and responded to the stories through a blog setup by the classroom
teacher. The research questions dealt with how the digital deVices could support primary
school readers as they interact with digital text as well as how the deVices could support
using e-books with their different ways of accessing books and manipulating texts.

The researcher observed that the students used the special features offered by the
e-reader to interact with the text and found that; by being able to use the features; students
were able to develop different skills on account of the nature of the deVices. Data
collected included interviews with students, teachers, classmates, and parents as well as
field notes; images of the notes students created on the Kindles. While reading on the
Kindles students changed the font size; accessed the dictionary to look up meanings of
words they did not know, and also used text to speech; to hear words they did not know.
They also wrote comments and questions as they read the text. The participants’
comments were categorized into the following topics: Understanding the text; text to self;
meaning making; response to questions and evaluation of text. While limited by the
number of students involved in the study this study provided insights into how use of e-
books and e-readers requires different skill sets and provides support to readers while
they are reading.

It is important for educators to be aware that different skill sets may be needed for
reading print and digital materials. Sometimes when students read online materials; they
become distracted by following hyperlinks or hotspots to other information rather than
staying focused on the topic they are supposed to be learning about. Following the

hyperlinks can cause students to become distracted by the options that are available

29

online that are not possible with print materials. While children’s interest in reading can
be peaked by the use of hotspots, it is not yet known how many hot spots detract from
children’s learning (Fisher, Lapp; & Wood; 2011). Some children do not use the hotspots
in e-books and in a pilot study students who did not use the hotspots had better
comprehension than those who did (Longa & Mich; 2013). De long and Bus (2002)
investigated the use of electronic books with 48 Dutch Kindergarten students from low
socio-economic status homes. The students were first diVided into three groups based on
literacy skills; then randomly placed into four groups: control group, computer book
restricted, computer book non-restricted; and regular book. The book chosen was
available in both print and e-book so all students interacted with the same material.
Students in the regular book were able to interact with the full book multiple times. Those
in the restricted computer book group were not permitted to play games available as part
of the book. They too read the book more than once but fewer times than those who read
the regular book. Students in the non-restricted computer book group spent a good deal of
time in the games and did not read the full book as much as the other groups. Thus
educators need to provide students with explicit instruction on how to read online
materials more deeply (Fisher et al.; 2011).

E-books have been found to assist the learning of literacy skills for young
children; struggling readers; and those who are learning a new language (Korat; 2010;
Lin; 2010; Moody; 2010; Moody; Justice; & Cabell; 2010; Shamir & Shlafer; 2011).
Korat (2010) studied 90 Israeli children in ﬁve Kindergarten and five first grade classes
to investigate how much e-books could support vocabulary and story comprehension. The

control group participated in regular literacy instruction while the intervention group read

30

the same e-book 5 times on computers, independently. The e-book was designed for the
study based on a print book; recommended for the age group. Specific interventions were
built into the e-books including narration and a dictionary feature. Vocabulary and word
recognition were tested before and after the study but comprehension was tested at the
end. The results showed that students in both the kindergarten and first grade groups
benefited from the e-book activities in vocabulary; word recognition; and comprehension;
with ﬁrst graders scoring higher in the higher level questions. Some of the limitations of
this study are: a contrived e-book was used rather than a commercially available one.
Additionally; comprehension was not pre-tested.

Some interactive e-books can provide scaffolding for young readers by giving the
correct pronunciation of words on demand to increase readers’ comprehension of the
story. This can also present children with a feeling of independence as they opt for
assistance when they need it (Peannan & Chang; 2010). Furthermore e-books can assist
with learning vocabulary as well as comprehension. Kindergarten and ﬁrst-grade students
who read e-books several times demonstrated improved literacy skills in vocabulary and
comprehension (Korat; 2010). Literacy skills improve for students with learning
challenges as a result of features that provide support for their learning needs (Shamir &
Shlafer, 2011). Features present in e-books change the way that books are traditionally
read to, or with children. A story can be read with a child as print books are often read,
but there are important differences. Interactive features can allow for the story to be read
to the child or render assistance to a child who is reading independently (Roskos, Brueck;
& Widman, 2009). While these features can be beneﬁcial; children can become

dependent on the narrations and other features and take fewer risks in decoding new

31

words if they become overly dependent on e-books (Morgan; 2013). Some possible
negative aspects of digital text are that readers can be distracted by other features in the
digital text and readers may not read digital materials as quickly as print materials
(Wright, Fugett, & Caputa, 2013). Some hotspots may cause students to become
distracted while reading; impeding learning instead of promoting it (Morgan; 2013).
These concerns can be outweighed by the benefits of e-books (Wright et al.; 2013) but
teachers and others using e-books for instruction can diminish these concerns by carefully
selecting multimodal e-books (Morgan; 2013).

Reading is a complex cognitive process that requires students to encode what they
read, place it into their working memory, and then store the information in a way that it
can be retrieved (Liang & Huang; 2014). Liang and Huang (2014) studied the reading
rate patterns of elementary students in Taiwan. Twenty-four sixth grade students
participated in the study. The students read one print book and one e-book each week for
three weeks under the supervision of a graduate student. The books were in Chinese and
were on science topics. After each book was read students completed a retrieval task,
writing down what they had learned from the book. The study found that students’
reading rate changed depending on the task. The retrieval rate was slightly better for e-
books than print books in this study and students’ reading rates tended to be associated
with their retrieval rates. This study was conducted with 24 students, so more research is
needed with larger numbers of students. Additionally; the focus of the books was science
so other topics may derive different results. Finally, this study was conducted in Chinese.

Research in other languages could compare to see if the findings are similar.

32

Members of the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) have created
standards for student learning. Through these standards students are required to learn to
use resources in varying formats including digital formats (AASL; 2007). In order for
school librarians to assist students in meeting this standard, they must provide students
with exposure to resources in multiple formats. According to the National Board of
Professional Teaching Standards (2012); school librarians must develop a collection of
materials that meets the needs of their school. Additionally; the International Society for
Technology in Education (ISTE) (2012) has developed profiles for technology tasks
students of different ages should be able to accomplish. As part of the profile for Pre-
Kindergarten to second grade, students are expected to be able to maneuver through e-
books and software.

Role of the School Librarian

The role of school librarians has been evolving to require school librarians serve
their school communities in many ways; particularly as leaders in the integration of
technology (Johnston; 2012a). Traditionally; school librarians teach students how to
browse for books that are appropriate; and of interest to them. They also provide book
talks and lessons on using the library resources to encourage students to use materials that
are in the collection and there is still a need for these aspects of their positions (Hibbard
& Franklin; 2015). But school librarians can do more.

They can use their unique role in the school to promote student learning by
working with teachers to model the use of new technology in classrooms and by
providing instruction to teachers on skills they need to know to increase student

achievement (NBPTS; 2012; Zmuda & Harada, 2008). While school librarians must be

33

able to assist students in acquiring 21St century skills through the use of technology tools
their role is not always apparent to others so they may not be Viewed as capable of taking
on this role (Johnston; 2012b). Part of the problem is that librarians have traditionally
resisted breaking with traditional practice (Anderson; 2009).

The AASL (2013) has identified five interconnected; roles of school librarians:
leader; instmctional partner; information specialist; teacher; and program administrator.
The National Board of Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) (2012) has also
developed standards for library media that relate the expectation that school librarians
will use their leadership role to provide access to all students in the use of technology
tools. Leadership includes leading all members of the school community by developing a
21St century program within the school (AASL; 2013). Leadership also means reaching
out to organizations and advocating for the library program within the school (AASL;

20 13 ).

There is also an expectation that school librarians will continue to learn
throughout their careers and share what they learn with colleagues (NBPTS; 2012).
AASL (2103) has identified the role of instructional partner; this includes: setting goals;
planning; assessing and teaching instructional technology skills. Another important part
of this role is developing a school library that is accessible Virtually; and open around the
clock.

One important way that school librarians share their knowledge for the benefit of
students is through collaborations with teachers. Teachers sometimes find that they do
not have the occasion during their scheduled class time to teach library skills (Hibbard &

Franklin; 2015). School librarians can assist with this through collaboration, and these

34

collaborations can be Virtual and do not necessarily take place during the school day
(AASL; 2013). Collaborations occur between teachers and school librarians and are an
important aspect of the role of school librarians because school librarians can locate
materials that are appropriate to subject areas such as science that also meet the needs of
students with disabilities (Perrault, 2010; NBPTS, 2012). thus meeting the needs of all
learners.

In order to assist school librarians in taking on this collaborative role some
colleges and universities are developing courses that focus on developing instructional
partner skills (Moreillon; 2013). Moreillon (2013) investigated the final reﬂections of 61
graduate students in an online class that focused on developing skills in the instructional
partnership role. Around 2/3 of the class were classroom teachers, and the other third
were school librarians with emergency certificates practicing in school libraries with a
few working in college libraries. The course emphasized online collaborations through
discussions and collaborative projects. The course required students to collaborate with
three to four classmates using online tools that recorded their interactions. At the end of
the course students were asked to reﬂect on three questions dealing with changes in their
thinking about instructional partnerships; what they understood differently about
instructional partnerships; and a description of how they came to that way of thinking in
150 words. They also were expected to comment on the postings of two other students in
the class. The researcher then coded the comments for this study. The most common
comment made by participants in response to the question about what changed their
thinking was working with various collaborative partners. Responses from classroom

teachers in the group mentioned the importance of collaborative lesson planning in

35

changing their understanding of instructional partnerships. Those participants who were
librarians discussed the importance of reaching out to teachers to develop instmctional
partnerships. Academic preparation programs for school librarians can incorporate
opportunities for instmctional partnerships into their programs to prepare students for this
role (Moreillon; 2013).

Another role identified that school librarians must embrace; is that of information
specialist. As an information specialist the school librarian models the use of new
technologies and adds to the resources available to the school community through the use
of technology. In addition, the information specialist finds ways to make resources
available at all times not just when school is open. The media specialist in the role of
information specialist also provides information about intellectual rights and helps bridge
global relationships between the school and others.

Another role that media specialists must fill is that of teacher. Media specialists
provide instruction to students in research for assignments but also for personal
knowledge; reading for enjoyment but also to gain understanding; as well as the use of
materials in multiple formats (AASL; 2013). A very important part of this role is
developing a library program that is accessible to all stakeholders including those with
learning challenges. This includes the physical library space. The space must conform to
American Disabilities Administration (ADA) guidelines. These guidelines also provide
requirements about how the library collection is accessed; perhaps using Assistive
Technology (AT) and materials in formats compatible with AT or library materials that
include fonts and characters for those who have Visual challenges (Subramaniam; et al.;

2013)

36

Media specialists are also program administrators. Through this role they work
with others within the school and community to develop a library program that is
available to all through the physical library space; as well as Virtually. In this role mission
statements are created and strategic plans developed with the input of others. The
program administrator role also requires the media specialist to develop a budget for the
school library and manage any staff or volunteers who work in the library.

There is an increasing need for school librarians to take on a leadership role in
implementing new technologies; but some school librarians tend to avoid taking on this
role (Dotson & Jones, 2011). One of the factors that prevent school librarians from taking
on a leadership role in the use of technology in their school is that they do not have the
required technology skills and knowledge to assume this role (Johnston; 2012b). Thus
professional development and other trainings are very important for school librarians as
they take on changes in their role. They are also important for those in preparation
programs to become school librarians. Dotson and Dotson—Blake (2015) investigated the
technology integration experiences of school library interns who participated in
internships in schools. A link to an online web-based survey was sent to all students who
took a library science internship course at a southeastern university between 2010-2014.
A significant majority reported that they modeled integration of technology tools; 80%
promoted digital citizenship and 70% designed lessons that incorporated technology into
instruction. There were much lower numbers of interns who organized professional
development and materials for teachers or coached teachers to promote technology

enhanced learning but the majority did participate in these activities. The second part of

37

the study explored the constmcts and critical standards that were emphasized in this
particular school library internship program.
Professional Development for School Librarians

Many school librarians that hold positions requiring the use of digital resources
did not receive preparation in their coursework while in school to handle these materials
(Laskowski, 2010). They need to be educated on the ways that digital resources such as
e-books can provide access to learning materials that meet the needs of students with
disabilities (Subramaniam et al.; 2013). Often school librarians find themselves learning
the skills they need while servicing their patrons (Laskowski, 2010). In order to
determine areas in which they need to improve, school librarians can reﬂect on their
skills and base professional development choices on areas in need of improvement or use
an evaluation tool (NBPTS; 2012; Lee & Klinger; 2011). De Groot and Branch (2011)
investigated the attitudes and experiences of graduates of a distance learning masters
program that prepares teacher librarians in Alberta; Canada. Those surveyed graduated
between 2003 and 2008. Out of 30 invitations 28 participants completed the online open-
ended survey. The results showed that participants felt strongly that there was a need to
continue learning about emerging technologies past graduation from the program.
Participants also discussed the need to know about topics involving technology and the
integration of technology in schools. They expressed a need for continuing education in
new topics as they arise; so school librarians could stay current. They also discussed
topics that they believed were no longer relevant. That included the use of print resources
for reference and research as well as time spent learning to catalog materials. Participants

suggested that more time should have been spent learning how to search for materials

38

using the catalog since many school librarians no longer catalog materials as part of their
duties.

Lee and Klinger (2011) used case studies to investigate eight elementary school
libraries identiﬁed as exemplary in Ontario; Canada. The libraries that were studied were
located in geographic regions that ranged from semi-rural to large cities. Two of the case
studies were more in-depth; including observations of the school librarians while the
other siX did not include observations of the librarians. The data from interviews and
observations were coded and a continuum for library programs was developed.
Interviews and student surveys were used for this study. Narratives were developed that
led to a continuum of school library programs. Three areas stood out in exemplary library
programs: Librarians focusing on teaching, change agents; and school context. The
continuum can be used by school librarians to self-evaluate their programs or it could
become a collaborative tool for groups of librarians to assist each other in evaluating
library programs.

Professional organizations provide opportunities for school librarians to acquire
the skills and knowledge they need to fulfill their role as technology leaders by offering
conferences, and professional development in technology as it relates to the school
library (Johnston; 2012a; Leverkus, 2013). But in order to take advantage of what is
offered; school librarians must desire to accept new technologies and take on these new
roles and many school librarians prefer more traditional roles (Dotson & Jones, 2011).

Johnston (2013) used responses to two open—ended questions that were part of a
survey conducted by Partnerships Advancing Library Media Center (PALM) to

investigate barriers and enablers to technology integration among practicing nationally

39

certified school librarians. The survey was part of the School Library Media Specialist
and Technology Integration survey. The open—ended questions were about barriers and
facilitators to their (media specialists’) technology integration. Participants in the survey
were practicing Media Specialists who were National Board Certified by 2009. Of the
completed surveys; 295 were useable for this study because the open—ended questions
were complete. A content analysis was performed to identify the barriers and enablers.
Then the four domains of supports and barriers to teacher leadership by Zinn were
applied. Professional organizations were the most commonly identified enabler to
technology integration by those responding. The three areas identified through the open-
ended responses were support; networking; and mentoring (J ohnston, 2013). Participants
felt empowered and supported by mentoring of colleagues in the professional
organizations. They also discussed that participating in the professional organizations as
helping them stay current in their ﬁeld.

School librarians are obligated by federal laws to provide equal access to the
library collection as well as facilities and instruction within the school library but in
multiple studies teacher librarians have reported that they do not feel that they have the
training to adequately meet the needs of special needs students (Myhill; Hill; Link; Small;
& Bunch; 2012). Several studies have identified deﬁcits in the knowledge of school
librarians in serving students with disabilities (Subramaniam et al.; 2013). Top programs
that prepare school librarians often do not have requirements for coursework in learning
to meet the learning and information needs of special education students. (Myhill et al.;

2013). But there is a need to train pre-serVice school librarians through coursework or to

40

provide those already practicing in school libraries with professional development so they
can serve their special populations (Subramaniam et al.; 2013).
School Library Digital Collections

Traditionally; school library collections have been based on the accumulating
physical materials on the shelves - ownership of those materials. When budgets were
tight, materials were still on the shelves from past purchases. The advent of digital
libraries has changed the landscape of library collections because electronic materials can
be based on access instead of ownership (Kimmel; 2014).

Challenges arise in school library digital collections when students and staff do
not have access to the technology needed to access the digital materials (Pearce & Rice;
2013). In surveys of third grade teachers in Ohio; almost a hundred percent have access
to computers in their classrooms but there was a great disparity in technology support and
sophistication level of lessons between schools located in the suburbs versus those
located in major urban or rural areas (Wood & Howley, 2012). There is also a disparity in
the type of connections available to students at home. A broadband Internet connection
allows for larger ﬁle downloads and faster download speeds but minorities; those less
educated; and individuals with low incomes are included in the 30% of Americans who
do not have a broadband connection (Cohron; 2015).

Loertscher and Marcoux, (2010) describe the concept of a school library that is
open and ﬂexible; and that is available to users at any time. In order for patrons to use
digital resources, they must be easily accessed; and patrons need to know how to do this
(Buczynski; 2010). Often it is easier to locate e-books than print materials if the record

can be found when searching the catalo g or a database (Buczynski; 2010; van der Velde

41

& Ernst; 2009). There are free digital book sites for children that can be accessed at no
cost like Project Gutenberg’s Children’s Literature Book Shelf; Children’s Books Online:
the Rosetta Stone Project and International Children's Digital Library (ICDL) (Martens;
2012). In order to provide access to technology such as digitalized books; school
librarians must have knowledge about them but if librarians are resistant to learning these
skills or do not feel they are important they will be unable to provide this access
(Aharony; 2013).

Students in kindergarten to fifth grade have varied developmental levels that must
be taken into account when making decisions about how materials are accessed. These
developmental levels determine what students are capable of understanding about the
way materials are organized for searching. Tools such as Online Public Access Catalogs
(OPACs) that assist with searching for print or digital materials must provide varied
interfaces that meet the needs of all students (Martens; 2012). Often OPACs include text
and vocabulary that are difﬁcult for younger children to navigate independently
(Meredith; 2015) so school librarians must consider how students will be able to access e-
books.

There are questions about whether digital text can be used for academic purposes.
Connell, Bayliss; and Farmer (2012) investigated the use of print; Kindles, and iPads for
comprehension. The participants were 201 undergraduate students at a college in the
United States. The study compared comprehension levels of the students on specific
deVices or in print. The materials used for this study five-question pre-test; a
comprehension article and 4 post-tests with 20 questions. After the pretests were

administered, students were provided with the same article either on a deVice or in print

42

and timed while reading the article. Then students were timed again when they took the
post—test. Students read print materials faster than on the deVices but preferred the tablet
to print material for personal reading. There was no difference in reading comprehension
between the print materials and the deVices.

In another study Margolin, Driscoll, Toland, and Kegler, (2012) investigated the
use of print; computer, and Kindle e-reader for comprehension. Ninety students from a
psychology class at a university in New York were diVided into three groups — one for
reading print; another for reading on a computer and yet another for reading on Kindles.
The groups were pretested then read several articles and completed comprehension tests
after each article. There was no signiﬁcant difference found in comprehension of the
materials between deVices and print. Participants in this study reported that they would
use deVices for reading e-textbooks.

There are few studies comparing print to digitalized text in elementary schools.
One study by Jones and Brown (2011) investigated the effect of electronic books on
reading engagement. One third-grade class consisting of 22 students from an urban
school in the United States participated in the study. The investigation had three phases.
In the first phase students read a print chapter from the series, the Box Car Children. The
first two chapters were read aloud using “bump reading” where one student reads and
then chooses another student to continue the reading. The third chapter was read silently.
This was followed by a mapping activity; comprehension test and an enj oyment survey.
The second phase involved students exploring the site Raz-Kids, an e-book site to
become familiar with the site and tools. Then student read e-books on the site. The title

chosen for this phase was The Mystery Wind e-book. The bump reading strategy was

43

used again followed by a mapping activity; a comprehension test and an enj oyment
survey. The third phase involve reading another e-book from Raz-Kids, The Sweet Potato
Challenge. The bump reading strategy was used again followed by a mapping activity a
comprehension test and an enjoyment survey. The investigation found that students had
about the same engagement and comprehension scores for the first and third book but
lower scores on the second book. The enjoyment survey results showed that students did
not enjoy the second book. The results of the survey showed that students did not prefer
one format over the other. This study is based on a small number of participants. E-books
were read on school laptops so results may be different if the study were done on e-
readers. The most important information to glean from this study is that students perform
better when they have the option of selecting their own reading material.

School library collections are required by ADA requirements to meet the needs of
those identified as having disabilities. The collection should include materials that present
characters as diverse; so the patrons with special needs can identify with the characters.
Additionally; the formats should be varied so that they include materials in many formats
including e-books, audio books; larger print; etc.; to meet the diverse needs of these
students and staff and also meet the requirements of student Individualized Education
Program (IEP) (Subramaniam et al.; 2013).

In addition to students with disabilities, school libraries are required through
national and international library standards to provide materials to support their culturally
and linguistically diverse populations they serve but there are challenges to locating

appropriate material in languages other than English (Paganelli & Houston; 2013). The

44

guidance of school librarians is important because students must learn how to locate and
access the materials (Lamb & Johnson; 2014).

Some schools are moving to fully digitalized collections. Cushing Academy, a
preparatory school in Boston; and Benilde-St. Margaret's School located in Minneapolis;
shifted to becoming almost completely digitalized in an effort repurpose physical space
used by the libraries for print materials (Medeiros; 2010; Lamb & Johnson; 2014). A few
years later the Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School opened an online library for students
(Lamb & Johnson, 2014). Not all the books that were available in a school print
collection were available as e-books because not all print materials are suitable for
digitalization (Medieros; 2010). However all three schools invested in digitalized books
and online databases (Lamb & Johnson, 2014). Although the Pennsylvania Cyber Charter
School is an online school; the school continues to provide students access to print
materials by mail (Lamb & Johnson, 2014) so there is still a need for some print materials
in school libraries at this time. Even today; some publishers are not selling digitalized
books to libraries although they are selling them on Amazon. This means that many of
the popular books that students would like to read are simply not available as e-books
from libraries (Bishop & Visser; 2013). Nevertheless, the trend is toward digitization and
students need to be prepared to use digital sources. Digitalized books provide students
with opportunities to read more books on demand and also provide easy access to online
digital tools (Wright, Fugett, & Caputa, 2013).

This study by Connell, Bayliss; and Farmer (2012) presents the results of an
investigation of 201 undergraduate students at a college in the United States. The purpose

of the study was to compare comprehension levels of students on specific deVices or in

45

print. The materials used for this study were five-question pre-test, a comprehension
article; and 4 post-tests with 20 questions. Kindles; iPads, and printed reading materials
were used for the experiment. After the pretests were administered, students were
provided with the same article either on a deVice or in print and were timed while reading
the article. Then students were timed again when they took the post-test.

Students read print materials faster than on the deVices but preferred the tablet to
print material for personal reading. There was no difference in reading comprehension
between the print materials and the deVices.

Nevertheless, the trend is toward digitization and students need to be prepared to
use digital sources. Digitalized books provide students with opportunities to read more
books on demand and also provide easy access to online digital tools (Wright, Fugett, &
Caputa, 2013).

Formats of E-Books for School Libraries

Choosing e-books for a school library can be a very challenging process. When
libraries purchase print books there are no restrictions on how many times the physical
books are lent except through the wear and tear caused by circulation; this is called the
doctrine of ﬁrst sale right. That doctrine does not apply to e-purchases. Purchases of e-
content require that librarians learn new models for how digital materials are acquired
and shared (Sathyanarayana, 2013). The use of digital materials such as e-books are
guided by Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) which was passed by Congress in
1998 to protect the rights of those who create digital products such as e-books. Digital
Rights Management (DRM) is part of the interface used to View e-books and limits how

e-books are used (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014). Thus school librarians need to be informed

46

about the differences between print and digital purchases and their implications for
circulation. The limitations for how e-books can be used can also create ethical dilemmas
for librarians as materials that previously could be lent to not members of the school
community are now restricted by logins (Reinsfelder; 2014) this could even impact
interlibrary loan because print materials could be mailed to other schools or used by those
in the physical space of the library but without a login; digital products could be
inaccessible. Recently librarians who are part of the Greater Western Library Alliance
worked with software developers from Texas Tech and the University of Hawaii to
collaborate in developing the first software program that would securely allow for sharing
e-books among cooperative universities through interlibrary loan. A successful pilot of
the program was implemented when phase two of the project has begun (Litsey &
Ketner; 2015).

User privacy is another area of concern for information professionals when
purchasing digital products from vendors. Sometimes vendors collect information about
what users are reading including specific pages that are read. Ensuring patron privacy is
an important ethical responsibility for an information professional so in order to address
this; information professionals can stress concerns to vendors and choose those who
ensure privacy of users. It is also important to be aware of privacy laws as they are
changing to meet the new challenges brought about by digital products (Reinsfelder;

20 14).

The type of deVices that will be used to access digital acquisitions is an important

consideration when purchasing digital material (Kimmel; 2014). If e-books are purchased

but cannot be accessed by deVices used by patrons at the school; the materials will not be

47

used. Access to materials is a very important consideration for school librarians, it must
be as unencumbered for patrons as possible (Kimmel; 2014) this is especially important
for elementary school students who are just learning to navigate library resources.

School librarians need to understand the many ways that e-books are packaged,
called platforms, but also how even the e-books they may have in their collections,
continue to evolve due to innovations and policy changes (RonceVic; 2013b). E-books in
school libraries can be as simple as text only, text with narration; or they can be
multimodal with Videos and or hotspots. Some e-books for elementary schools include
games or links to social media sites.

The first e-book for children appeared in the mid-1990s and consisted of files on
CD-ROM (Bus; Takacs, & Kegel; 2015). At present time e-books for school children are
files housed on a school or district server; cloud based or even apps (Zipke, 2014). Some
choices for purchases of e-books are in the form of subscriptions for a set period of time;
other e-books are owned by the school library, but housed off site for free; still others are
owned; but housed off site for a fee (Acedo & Leverkus; 2014; Ennis & Baylis; 2013;
Culley; 2015) or more recently can be purchased for a school library through patron
driven acquisition programs (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014; Ennis & Bayliss; 2013). There
are a few publishers such as Harper Collins that are offering limited-licensing which
allows for an e-book to be used a specific number of times then must be repurchased or
disappears from the collection (Ennis & Bayliss; 2013).

TumbleBook Library; Capstone MyOn, and StarWalk Kids Media are examples
subscription e-book services for elementary schools providing access to e-books for K-5

students (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014; Enis & Bayliss; 2013). Students can read the books

48

themselves or use the narration feature, which in many cases can be used as an
accommodation for those students with special needs (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014; Enis &
Bayliss; 2013). Subscriptions can provide access to more e-books in a particular subject
area (Cully; 2015). New ways of thinking may be necessary for school librarians who
traditionally thought of collections based on ownership. Subscriptions for short periods of
time could provide greater access to materials needed for a unit of study for a class
costing much less than an investment in physical books or owning the e-book outright
(Kimmel; 2014).

Capstone; Follett, and Mackin are examples of companies that sell e-books for
elementary schools and host them for free with a perpetual license. The e-books can be
accessed at school or remotely using a login. E-books from Capstone are USA and can be
accessed remotely using a group login. Follett and Mackin sell both USA and single user
license e-books (Enis & Bayliss; 2013). The books can be accessed through the library
OPAC with links provided by MARC records. E-books for use with elementary students
can also be purchased as perpetual licenses. This type of purchase become a permanent
part of the collection but is stored off site. Capstone provides e-books in this format. The
e-books can be accessed through the OPAC using a link in a MARC record. Capstone
does not charge a fee for storing the e-books on their site (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014).
Questions arise about the e-book collection when e-books are purchased under perpetual
license but the school is merged with another school or split into two different schools
(Sathyanarayana; 2013).

Gale Cengage; Baker & Taylor AXis 360; and OverDrive are examples of

companies that sell e-books for elementary schools and charge a fee for storing them. The

49

fees are usually based on the size of the school or district (Enis & Bayliss; 2013). So even
if e-books are purchased from these vendors; school librarians must plan for these fees
within their school library budgets.

Demand Driven Acquisitions (DDA) also known as Patron Driven Acquisitions
(PDA) are collection development choices that often provide patrons with a large
selection of e-book titles for no cost until a patron borrows an e-book. Once that takes
place the library is charged a fee for that particular e-book. Some studies have found that
patron chosen books are more widely circulated than those that are chosen by librarians
(Culley; 2015). Brain Hive is a service for elementary schools that provides access to
thousands of e-books with PDA. Each time an e-book is downloaded the school library is
charged $1.00 (Enis & Bayliss; 2013). Some companies such as EBSCO, sell e-books to
school more than one purchasing model: subscription; perpetual license, or PDA (Acedo
& Leverkus; 2014).

Weeding is a process used in library collections to remove material from the
collection to make more space for newer materials. With print materials the books that
are removed can be dirty or in need of repair but they can also be out of date or no longer
useful to patrons (Curley; 2015; Crosetto, 2012). With e-books there is no need to make
physical space available, but too many results in Virtual space can interfere with locating
relevant digital materials making it more difficult for patrons to access materials they
need (Culley; 2015; Crosetto; 2012).

Current Trends in the Librarian's Role in E-book Acquisitions
The landscape of school librarianship is changing quickly and school library

professionals must be able to adjust to their new roles. There are new trends in collection

50

tools and the way materials are presented to patrons. Each of these trends is inﬂuenced by
the others.

There is a trend toward PDAs also known as DDAs in library collection
development (Carrico, Cataldo; Botero & Shelton; 2015) even in elementary school
libraries (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014). PDA and DDA are a means of purchasing library
materials based on use by patrons (Goedeken & Lawson; 2015). The purchases are
triggered in most cases without the knowledge of the library patron (Goedeken &
Lawson; 2015). Until the advent of FDA; collection development was exclusively in the
realm of librarians who developed and followed guidelines to assist them with the
process of collection development to meet the needs of library patrons (Goedeken &
Lawson; 2015). Librarians built library collections based on current and long term need
of patrons; but PDA mainly deals with developing the collection based on current needs.

This trend toward the use of FDA began in the 2000s but was not used much until
recently when due to financial crises, adopting of e-books, and a need to demonstrate a
return on investments, it has become a trend (Dewland & See; 2015). In some cases PDA
began as a program to add print materials requested through Inter Library loan (ILL) to
the library collection; but PDA continues to evolve even today and is increasing in
popularity especially with purchases of digital materials (Freeman; Nixon; & Ward; 2015;
Goedeken & Lawson; 2015; Dewland& See; 2015). There are important differences in
the way PDA programs for print were used to acquire library materials because with ILL
patrons know what they need in advance and put in a request for that material. In using
PDA with digital materials such as e-books, patrons select materials from records in the

library OPAC (Freeman; et al.; 2015). Researchers have been conducting studies to

51

determine effectiveness of FDA and DDA programs, particularly at academic or
university libraries (Goedeken & Lawson; 2015; Dewland& See; 2015). One study at the
University of Arizona banded a team to develop metrics to evaluate the On Demand
Information Delivery (ODID) program at that university. One of the challenges for those
evaluating the program was the different data formats that were challenging to integrate.
There were also inconsistencies in the way information was entered into the MARC
records that caused problems with data as well. Discovery records have been added to the
searchable records with links to books in electronic format if they are available. The
university has also ﬁltered the records so that patrons are choosing materials that will
enhance the collection. The program has reduced the acquisition budget and made
purchasing materials for patrons easier (Dewland& See; 2015).

The University of Florida also brought a team together to determine cost and
usage of e-books. The evaluators looked at three different ways that libraries acquire e-
book titles for their collections including PDA. The team also had to View how the
acquisitions differed between various schools within the university. They found that all
three methods of acquisitions had value, and that even though some packages were more
expensive; some of the titles within those packages had a lot of patron use (Carrico et al.;
20 15).

Another area of change is in the way library materials are presented to patrons.
The OPAC has been a staple in libraries for decades but in the past eight years great
strides have occurred in the way the OPAC presents records of the materials available at
a library to patrons. Older versions of library software are often text—laden and do not

work well when words are spelled incorrectly or provide alternative choices for

52

misspellings while more modern discovery tools do (Weare; Toms & Breeding; 2011).
As discovery tools have evolved they have emulated web interfaces with more images,
such as book covers and information that goes beyond what is available from marc
records (Breeding; 2014). More modern discovery tools are more user friendly and
display the materials housed within the library collection but can also include products
that are housed off site such as databases and e-books providing patrons with the ability
to search all of the materials available in one place (Breeding; 2014). One of the
complexities of providing searches that combine all sorts of materials from different
vendors; is ensuring that all that the library has contracted for is available to patrons
while at the same time respecting licensing agreements and providing access at the levels
that were agreed upon with different vendors (Breeding; 2014).

Now because of the digitalization of libraries the OPAC can provide patrons with
direct access to library materials at any time of the day and without having to physically
enter a library (Kumar; 2013). Another big change in libraries is in the business models
for how materials are purchased for library collections because materials that are needed
can become available to patrons immediately; and if used enough can become a
permanent part of the collection (Goedeken & Lawson; 2015). This is done by loading
the marc records for the materials into the online library system and purchases are
triggered by patrons as they access the records (Goedeken & Lawson; 2015) so the
discovery tools are an important part of FDA.

One hundred forty-ﬁve Information professionals in Israel were surveyed to
determine their attitudes toward the use of discovery tools. The majority of those who

participated in the investigation were librarians at academic libraries with some public

53

school librarians and two school librarians participating as well (Aharony & Prebor;
2015). Eight questionnaires including two open—ended questions were used for this
investigation. The researchers wanted to explore the current use of discovery tools and
whether TAM could explain librarians’ and information professionals’ intentions to use
them. Other factors were also explored cognitive appraisal; personality dimensions and
computer use. (Aharony & Prebor; 2015). The researchers found that those who perceive
discovery tools as a challenge rather than a threat had a greater tendency to use the tools.
It was also found that those who found discovery tools useful were more likely to use
them. Personality traits of openness also go along with those who are accepting of
discovery tools. Computer use was also associated with those who used discovery tools
(Aharony & Prebor; 2015)
Summary

Publishers have reported that e-book sales have risen in children’s and young
adult books (Milliot, 2015). In spite of this one fifth of elementary and middle school
librarians reported that patrons at their school had access to at least 100 e-books (Farmer;
2011). Part of the reason for this may be that purchasing e-books can be much more
complicated than purchasing print books (Zucker et al.; 2009). E-books also require
technology deVices to be accessed and school librarians must consider how their students
will access them (RonceVic; 2013b).

In spite of the many challenges in implementing the use of e-books, they have
been found to assist with improving the literacy skills of students, including students
learning a new language or those with special learning needs (Korat; 2010; Lin; 2010;

Moody; 2010; Moody; Justice, & Cabell, 2010; Shamir & Shlafer, 2011). It is also

54

important to take into account that students have developmental needs when accessing
online resources and these needs should be taken into account (Martens; 2012).

School librarians play an important role in gaining acceptance for new technology
that can inﬂuence student success at their schools through collaboration, leadership;
providing training; mentoring colleagues; modeling use of new resources and including
new resources such as e-books in their collections (Zmuda & Harada; 2008; Everhart;
2007; NBPTS; 2012). In order to meet this responsibility; school librarians must be
reﬂective about the knowledge and skills they need to make decisions about which
resources should be part of the school library collection (NBPTS; 2012). Digital
resources can provide teachers with tools that can improve success in acquiring skills; but
if this is to occur; school librarians must be willing to add them to the school library
collection (Korat; 2010; Lin; 2010; Moody; 2010; Moody et al.; 2010; Shamir & Shlafer;
2011). There are conferences, online learning opportunities and many other resources
available to school librarians through their professional organizations that can assist them
with gaining the required skills to integrate digital resources such as e-books into their
library collections (Johnston; 2012a; Leverkus; 2013).

Thus it is important to investigate how school librarians feel about accepting e-
books in their school libraries. Aharony (2014a) used TAM to study factors inﬂuencing
how information professionals in Israel adopt e-books. The TAM has been around since
Davis first developed it in 1989 (Davis, 1989). It has been cited by researchers thousands
of times (Hess et al.; 2014). This model has been used to investigate the factors that
inﬂuence library professionals’ adoption of e-books and other technology innovations

(Aharony; 2015). TAM has been extended to include many different constructs in well

55

over 700 investigations of technology acceptance but some researchers have related that
it may be too simple to explain something as complicated as technology acceptance

(Bagozzi; 2007).

Chapter 3: Research Method

Library resources have increasingly become available in digitalized form
(Aharony, 2015) but some school librarians are not acquiring e-books in their collections;
currently; over 44% of school library collections do not include e-books (School Library;
2013). New media innovation, such as adoption of e-books for school libraries, involves a
constant tension between determination and contingency; or between order and
uncertainty (Lievrouw; 2012 p. 4) for personnel involved in the adoption process. School
librarians in exemplary schools serve as “change agents,” for their schools by introducing
new resources and have the potential to lead members of their school community to adopt
innovations (Lee & Klinger; 2011).

The increased use of e-books has pushed instructional uses for e-books into the
limelight; and use of e-books has been linked to improved student learning (Shamir &
Shlafer, 2011; Wright, Fugett, & Caputa, 2013). While some pre-serVice school librarians
consider the use of e-books as a threat to the profession; (Aharony, 2013) there is an
increasing need for school librarians to acquire digital resources and to initiate
collaborations with teachers to provide instmction to students on their use (Cooper &
Bray; 2011). Additionally; there is a need to study this topic in various contexts and
through the use of qualitative methods (Aharony, 2015). The problem is information
professionals continue dealing mostly with printed materials, and many appear
challenged and resistant in changing their student media centers to be mainly based on
digital materials; especially on e-books (Aharony 2015; 2014b).

The purpose of this qualitative study has been to explore how school information

professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books

57

within their organizations. This research provides school administrators with significant
information to develop strategies for overcoming challenges facing their information
professionals in faculty obstacles adopting new technologies; such e-books, in their
organizations. To obtain the appropriate answer, the right questions needed to be asked
(Browne & Keeley; 2007). As such, it became important to identify suitable questions for
the research. In line with the purpose of this study, the questions were as follows:

RQ1: How do school information professionals perceive adopting new
technologies such as e-books within their organizations?

RQ2: How do school information professionals perceive their personal challenges
in the adoption of new technologies such as e-books within their organizations?

RQ3: How do school information professionals perceive the organizational
barriers that challenge their adoption of new technologies such as e-books within their
organizations?

Research Method and Design

The research design for this investigation was a multiple-case study. The focus of
the investigation was how elementary school librarians were facing the challenges of
changing their school media centers to be mainly based on digital materials such as e-
books (Aharony 2014a; Aharony; 2014b).A multiple-case study complemented the
results of studies that have already been conducted by other researchers using quantitative
methods (Y in; 2014; Aharony; 2015). A multiple-case study allowed for comparing and
contrasting the cases to see parallels and divergences in how the individual elementary
school librarians and their organizations dealt with digital resources in school media

centers (Baxter & Jack, 2008). In opting for this method; consideration was given to the

58

type of research questions that were developed. According to Yin (2014) case studies are
an appropriate choice for studies with research questions that seek to explore how or
why. Additionally; the topic for this investigation was focused on events that are
contemporary rather than historical so case study was an appropriate choice for this
investigation (Yin; 2014).

This study was designed as a qualitative; exploratory multiple-case study in order
to understand complex social phenomena among separate cases. A multiple-case-study of
a social phenomenon may involve individual employees as a unit of study (Yin, 2014).
When the data focus is only on individual employees in a multiple-case-study design, the
study becomes employee-based at multiple organizational sites, as in the present research
in which the original phenomenon of interest; the decision-making process for elementary
school librarians when considering e-books in the school media center collection; is the
context and not the target of study (Eisenhardt & Graebner; 2007 ; Yin; 2013). The unit of
analysis was library professionals who work in elementary school media centers that
serve students in kindergarten through ﬁfth grade. The qualitative research method was
chosen for this study because of the depth of understanding this approach can provide for
the researcher. Qualitative research seeks to understand the world or a particular setting
from the perspectives of the people living in it. This design enables the researcher
to explore differences within and between cases (Yin; 2014).

The researcher anticipated conducting eight in-depth face-to-face individual
interviews with school information professionals at public elementary schools in the state
of New Jersey or until saturation is reached. Researchers suggest that no more than ten

participants are needed to reach thematic saturation for a qualitative study, and that siX to

59

ten interviews with participants is sufficient for a qualitative study (Mason; 2010).
Saturation in research is defined as the point when new data collection does not shed any
new insights in answering the research questions (O'Reilly & Parker, 2012). Qualitative
data was based on insights derived from in-depth interviews (Patton; 2002). Since the
study concentrated on a specific segment of the information sector instead of an eclectic
sampling, data collection was achieved with a purposeful sample using a snowball and
chain sampling strategy (Yin; 2014). Data was also collected through the maintenance of
field notes; archival documentation and subject matter expert examination of and
reﬂections on the data (Patton; 2002). Triangulation of data sources was conducted to
establish credibility of the researcher’s reﬂections on the phenomena under study (Yin,
20 14).

The selection of participants was purposeful because the researcher chose those
participants in order to provide access to as many varied school settings as possible
(Patton; 2002). For example; an effort was made to interview school librarians who serve
urban, suburban, and wealthier districts. Additionally; an attempt was made to recruit
school librarians who serve small schools and very large regional schools and who are
located in the northern; central, and southern regions of the state.

Population

The population from which each participant was drawn consists of seven public
schools in the state of New Jersey. The school information professionals selected were
employed primarily as school media specialists or associate media specialists from the
seven schools. The total number of school information professionals who work in school

libraries in New Jersey is 1486.02 (US. Department of Education; 2012).

60

Sample

Seven elementary school librarians who work at different public schools in the
state of New Jersey were recmited for this study. School librarians were recruited for
participation in this study by posting a request for participation on the LibraryLinkNJ
forums. A snowball effect was also utilized by requesting names of potential participants
from other library professionals. Moderators make decisions about whether items can be
posted on LibraryLinkNJ. Although LibraryLinkNJ is a professional organization for all
librarians in the state of New Jersey; requests can be made for a more limited group to
respond to a request. A posting was made to the LibraryLinkNJ forum requesting that
school librarians in New Jersey who were willing to be interviewed as part of a research
study contact the researcher through email or by phone. The researcher also requested
from those who responded; the names of other public school librarians who work in New
Jersey who were willing to be interviewed for the study.

Sampling criteria. This study used a purposeful sampling methodology in the
selection of seven elementary school library information professionals. Purposeful
sampling is appropriate for this study because the participants are information
professionals employed in public elementary school media centers and are responsible for
making decisions about the resources available to the school community through the
school media center collections. This exploratory study used seven in-depth interviews
through Facetime or Skype with elementary public school information professionals in
order to explore how school information professionals perceive the challenges of
adopting new technologies such as e-books within their organizations. This multiple-case

study was based on replication logic in which its results can be similar to the other cases;

61

or different from them based on theoretical predictions (Yin, 2015). In a multiple-case-
study research; each case is considered to be a separate study (Yin; 2015).

The researcher conducted seven individual interviews until saturation was
reached. No more than ten participants were needed to reach thematic saturation for a
qualitative study, and siX to ten interviews with participants is sufficient for a qualitative
study (Mason; 2010). Saturation in research is considered to be the point when new data
collection does not shed any new insights in answering the research questions (O'Reilly
& Parker; 2012).

Sample strategy. The collection of data for this study included the semi-
structured interviews. Participants for the study were recruited through purposive
sampling because participants were selected by the researcher based on their employment
at public elementary school media centers in New Jersey.

Permission was required to conduct research with school librarians. Recruitment
was conducted by posting a notice for research participation on the fomms of the website
for LibraryLinkNJ: A New Jersey Library Cooperative located at htmz/ﬂibraﬂlinknjorg.
Procedures for requesting permission to conduct research followed NCU IRB criteria.
Once a school librarian volunteered to participate in the study, the Informed Consent
Form was sent to the participant. This form contained an area for a signature from the
participant agreeing to take part in the study, and another area for a signature of the
participant to agree to be audio recorded and transcribed. The Informed Consent Form
was sent by email. Some participants faxed their forms to the researcher while others
mailed or returned forms in person. Participants were made aware that they had a choice

about responding or not responding to any question and that an audio recording was not

62

required. It was also explained that the purpose of the audio ﬁle was to assist the
interviewer in capturing what was said during the interview more accurately.
Material/Instruments

The primary tool used in this study was a semi-structured interview conducted
through Facetime or Skype; consisting of demographic questions, and ICT survey and
seven open—ended questions with follow-up questions as needed, ensuring that the
questions are fully answered by the interviewee (Rowley; 2012). Participants were
recruited through the LibraryLinkNJ forums, and email and were asked about their
willingness to participate in a research study. The email included a letter of introduction
(Appendix A) that outlined the nature and purpose of the research study and an estimate
of the time necessary for the interview, as well as a request to record the interview for
accuracy in data (Rowley; 2012). Once participants agreed to participate in the study a
consent form was presented to the participant through an email or mail (Appendix B).
The Interview Questionnaire assisted with accurately taking notes during the interview
process and recording the interviews for more accurate transcripts (Appendix C). The
interview was organized to take less than an hour (Yin, 2015) and consisted of
demographic questions, an ICT survey and seven open-ended questions. An interview
guide that included the demographic questions, ICT survey and each of the seven main
focus questions and sub-questions kept the novice interviewer and interviewee on track
and focused during the interview process (Rowley; 2012).

This study’s interview guide (see Appendix C) which consisted of seven open-
ended questions on the topic of exploring how school information professionals perceive

the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books within their organizations,

63

was designed by and standardized by Noa Aharony (2015) in seminal research originally
using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). She used this to explain individuals’
technology behaviors (Davis, 1989), and to predict factors that may inﬂuence information
professionals adopting e-books within their organizations. The objectives of this study
were “to explore: (a) the extent to which the TAM explains information professionals’
intentions to use e-books, (b) the extent to which personal characteristics such as motiva-
tion and cognitive appraisal explain information professionals’ intentions to use e-books,
and (c) the extent to which differences in demographic variables such as age and
education explain information professionals’ intentions to use e-books” (Aharony, 2014
p. 2).

Aharony’s (2014) study was conducted in Israel during the first semester and used
two groups of information professionals and participants: librarians and information
specialists and used four questionnaires to gather the following data: personal details;
attitudes to e-books, motivation, and a cognitive appraisal (Appendix A). The personal
details questionnaire has four statements. The e-books attitude questionnaire, based on
Liu et al. (2010), will be modified for this study from questions rated on a 7 -point Likert
scale (1=strongest disagreement; 7= strongest agreement) to 7 with opened ended
interview questions. Principal components factor analysis on the survey statements
revealed four distinct factors. The first related to information professionals’ behavioral
intention to use e-books (items 3; 5; 7 ; 11); the second, to information professionals’
perceptions about e-books’ ease of use (items 1; 8; 10); the third; to information
professionals’ personal innovativeness (items 4; 6; 9); and the fourth; to information

professionals’ perceptions about e-books’ usefulness (items 2; 12; 13). The values of

64

Cronbach’s Alpha were .82; .84; .83; and .70 respectively (Ahrony; 2014). Permission to
use, adapt and modify the survey statements to interview questions was provided to this
researcher by Prof. Noa Ahrony; it can be found in Appendix E. Five open ended
interview questions will be developed from the four areas Aharony identified as the
principal components of the instrument’s factor analysis. These questions are listed in
Appendix C.

Each participant also took an ICT Questionnaire (see Appendix D) to evaluate
each participant’s comfort level with using technology and e-books. The ICT
questionnaire consisted of 12 statements rated on a ﬁve-point Likert scale (1 = strongest
disagreement; 5 = strongest agreement). The instructions to the participants were: “Please
respond spontaneously with the first thoughts that come to mind upon hearing the
following statements”. This questionnaire was previously used (Shonfeld & Aharony;
2015). The value for the Cronbach's alpha of the questionnaire was .81. The validity of
this study’s instmmentation depends on the matter of transferability.

The researcher archived raw data and recorded interview sessions as supporting
documentation to the research findings, interpretations and generalizations reached..
Additionally; a numerical classification system was implemented for identifying
participants on interview documentation and relevant raw materials so as to maintain
confidentiality (Patton; 2002). Transferability is similar to external validity; as both
notions are involved with the amount to which the outcomes of one study can be useful to

other settings (Merriam; 2009).

65

Data Collection, Processing and Data Analysis.

The data for this study was collected from multiple sources but was primarily
focused on semi-structured interviews conducted through Skype or Facetime; that
explored how school information professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new
technologies such as e-books within their organizations. The interview questions (see
Appendix C) were asked in such a way as to allow participants opportunities to articulate
their own perceptions in their own words (Patton; 2002). The researcher recorded the
interviews when given permission; audio files were transcribed and notes were taken
during the interviews for easy retrieval (Yin; 2014).

The data collection phase focused on interviews and began after IRB reView and
approval from Northcentral University (N CU). Seven participants were selected to
participate in this study through purposive sampling and the snowball effect. Once
participants agreed to be interviewed; the participants were informed on the purpose of
the research (see Appendix A); all were practicing information professionals who work at
public schools that serve grades Kindergarten through fifth grade. The number of
participants was chosen because it is within the range considered appropriate for semi-
structured interviews that are around an hour long (Yin; 2014). Saturation is the point
when new data collection does not shed any new insights toward answering research
questions (O'Reilly & Parker, 2012). According to researchers; no more than ten
participants are needed to reach thematic saturation in a qualitative study, and siX to ten
interviews are sufficient for one. Furthermore continuing interviews after saturation

didn’t provide additional insights (Mason; 2010).

66

In order to increase construct validity multiple sources of eVidence were used in
this case study including semi-structured interviews (see Appendix C) and audio
recordings of interviews (whenever possible) (Yin, 2014). The interviews were recorded
only if the participant agreed (see Appendix B). The recorded files were transcribed and
added to the data in the data analysis software program with the notes taken by the
researcher during that interview (Yin; 2014).

The researcher used cross-case synthesis for data analysis in this multiple-case
study. This type of strategy allows for each case to be treated as a separate one with data;
then compared across case studies in order to strengthen the robustness of the research
results (Yin; 2014). The researcher created a table in Microsoft Word to organize
information for each case study in order to place data from each of the cases in categories
(Yin; 2014). Interpretations of the data were argumentative in nature rather than statistical
(Yin; 2014). In addition the researcher ensured that arguments were developed from and
supported by the data so that the arguments would be strong and fair (Yin; 2014). Cross-
case synthesis can be more robust than when conducting a single case study (Yin; 2014).

In order to ensure triangulation of data sources; the researcher collected and
compared the relevant data through observational field notes (Katz; 2014), content
analysis of interviews and questionnaires, examination of the reﬂections on the subject
matter; and data that was thematically coded (Baxter & Jack, 2008). Triangulation of data
sources established credibility of the researcher’s reﬂections on the phenomena under
study (Mason; 2010; Yin; 2014) to strengthen confidence in the results of this qualitative
research (Yin; 2014). The researcher took care to point out any errors or issues with the

accuracy of the data in an effort to be transparent.

67

The data from this qualitative multiple-case study can provide the basis for further
research but in order for this to occur the researcher must study outputs to determine the
important patterns that are emerging (Yin, 2014). The researcher analyzed the results in
order to take the initial data and work toward developing more fully expanded
explanations of the data; based on original research questions (Y in, 2014). Interview
questions were developed in an open—ended semi-structured question format (see
Appendix C); and prompts were used during interviews to encourage participants to
thoroughly discuss the interview questions. The information specialist participants work
in complex real-world settings so their responses to the interview questions were a part of
the eVidence collected. Other eVidence such archival documents and ﬁeld notes were
included to further support the interview data (Yin, 2014). Responses to the research
questions including participants’ insights were analyzed and interpreted, and all were
combined to form the basis for the conclusions of the study (Patton; 2002). Participants
had an opportunity to reView their case before the final reporting (Yin; 2014). The
researcher was familiar with some of the participants through participation in
professional organizations.

Validity strategies in qualitative research. The seven semi-structured
interviews allowed for focusing in on the specific topics of the case study and allowed for
the participants to provide their responses about the topic; but care was taken to avoid
reﬂexivity and response bias by showing the participants’ drafts of the portion of the case
study involving their case (Y in, 2014). Exploring a number of cases enhanced the

accuracy; validity; and reliability of the results (Noor; 2008). This View of the case study

68

also provided triangulation because participants could point out inaccuracies or change
some of their responses (Golfashani; 2003; Yin; 2014).

The field notes from the interviews provided convergence and supported eVidence
from the interviews and any inconsistencies between eVidence were addressed (Yin,
2014). Yin (2014) suggests using Internet searches as part of preparing for the study, and
most school media centers are present on the Internet. Most also have access to digital
resources on the web page. In order to ensure that each participant was indeed a public
elementary school librarian; the researcher searched the Internet to locate each participant
either through the school library web site or searched if they were listed as a staff
member on a school website; when no school library web site was available.

A digital journal was used to record discussions and documents to provide
organization and accuracy of records (Yin, 2014). The journal was organized by
questions and themes using letters and numbers. The first of the three research questions
was Q1 and the first theme under question 1 was A. The data was organized into a file
with documents stored as PDF ﬁles or image files. They too were organized by the same
coding system. Microsoft Excel, a spreadsheet program; was used to keep track of data in
an organized manner. Tables in word were used to assist with coding and analyzing data
from transcripts and notes from interviews to see themes in the data (Yin, 2014).
Assumptions

There were several assumptions made as the basis for this multiple-case-study
investigation. The first assumption involved the quality of responses obtained during the
interview process. It was assumed that those interviewed provided in-depth descriptions

of their how they perceived the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books

69

within their school media centers. The quality and depth of the data provided by
interviewees was dependent on their perceptions and Views that might have been
inﬂuenced by the school systems they represent.

The second assumption was that the responses to the interview questions posed by
the researcher were transparent and sincere. The third assumption was that digitally
recorded interview responses were accurately transcribed to obtain and present
participants’ meanings of the research issues. Finally; it was assumed that the use of
tables in Microsoft Word to analyze the data; and extract output from the data; brought to
light the relevant themes that were supportive of the narrative findings of the research.
Limitations

There were several limitations in this study. This multiple-case study was limited
to a small sample of siX to eight participants so the data was not discussed in terms of a
sample but in terms of analytic generalizations (Yin, 2015). This study was dependent on
the willingness of participants to donate their time and lack of time can impact the quality
of responses to interview questions. The researcher made an effort to schedule interviews
at times convenient for the interviewees. There may be some bias or inaccuracies in the
responses of those interviewed but those issues were lessened by use of corroborating
eVidence (Y in; 2015).

There is a balance of power during interviews between interviewees and
researchers. This is particularly true if the topic discussed is sensitive so as a novice
interviewer; the researcher; found these shifts in power challenging, which were another
limitation (Buchbinder; 2011). Therefore the researcher was reﬂective and sensitive to

the power shifts in the interview process.

70

The risk of reﬂexivity occurring during the interviews was another limitation. The
researcher took care to avoid inﬂuencing responses and guarded against allowing
responses to inﬂuence questioning during interviews (Yin, 2015). Careful writing to
avoid bias and use of voice balanced with analysis; assisted with guarding against this
(Patton; 2002).

In the validation process member checking provided interviewees with
opportunities to check the data for correct interpretations and to assist with developing
relationships of mutual respect between interviewees and the researcher (Buchbinder;
2011). Member checking was used at the end of each interview by reviewing questions
and participants’ responses with the interviewee; to ensure accuracy of notes taken during
the interview process. But there are some risks inherent in this process because there are
times when member checking is not appropriate; such as when an interviewee becomes
adversarial with the researcher (Cho & Trent, 2006). There was no incidence of
interviewees becoming adversarial during the interview.

Purposive sampling was another limitation because while it provided an
opportunity to investigate information professionals in different settings providing depth
and richness to the investigation, it also limited generalizability of the study and the
researcher was clear in describing the process for their selection (Patton; 2002).

Ethical Assu rances

Researchers communicate the purpose and expectations of their research with
study participants before interviews are conducted so as to protect them from harm and
ensure the process is in line with professional and ethical behavior (Patton; 2002;

Schram; 2006). . The researcher informed the participants about the purpose of this

71

research, data collection; ethical standards, and informed consent processes before
conducting the interviews (Shank, 2006). Research and data collection commenced only
after the IRB granted approval for the study to be conducted; and Informed consent
approval was obtained from research study participants prior to asking interview
questions (Shank, 2006). Participants’ questions and concerns were addressed to ensure
understanding about the informed consent process and interview questions (Patton;
2002). They were also informed that participation was voluntary and their responses
would remain anonymous (Yin; 2014).

Various safeguard mechanisms were employed to ensure that participants’
information remained private and followed the informed consent procedures set out by
NCU. Raw data; digitally recorded interview sessions, transcribed notes; information
sources; and researcher documentation pertinent to the study would be stored in a secure
setting and would be archived for at least 7 years. A back-up system was activated to
secure the storage of all electronic files. Additionally; hard copy materials such as
handwritten notes are stored in a locked ﬁle box that is locked when not in use by the
researcher.

High ethical standards were applied in this research process by respecting
participants’ right to privacy and confidentiality (Patton; 2009). Participants were not
screened; and thus were not discriminated against, in relation to factors such as age; race;
gender, religion; or cultural background. Member checking was conducted with the
participants who, rather than being identified by name and responses; remained
anonymous due to the use of a numerical classification system (Merriam; 2009). To

ensure academic integrity with peers, the researcher presented truthful positions and

72

statements regarding the research study and resulting outcomes (Y in; 2014). The
combination of these ethical considerations remained signiﬁcant to the successful
completion of this research study (Yin; 2014).

Summary

This qualitative research study involved multiple-case studies. The primary data
was semi-structured interviews but triangulation of the data through sources of eVidence
added to the validity and reliability of the study. Participants for this study were recruited
through a forum and email. Purposeful and snowball sampling were used to acquire
participants for this investigation that are from a variety of library settings within the state
of New Jersey.

The primary limitation to this study was that this multiple-case study was limited
to a small sample of seven participants so the data was not be discussed in terms of a
sample, but was discussed in terms of analytic generalizations (Yin; 2015). This study
was dependent on the willingness of participants to donate their time ,and lack of time
could have impacted the quality of responses to interview questions.

There were some assumptions made as the basis for this multiple-case study
investigation. The first assumption involved the quality of responses obtained during the
interview process. It was assumed that those interviewed provided in-depth descriptions
of how they perceived the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books
within their school media centers. The quality and depth of the data provided by
interviewees was dependent on their perceptions and Views that may have inﬂuenced by
the school systems they represent. The second assumption was that the responses to the

interview questions posed by the researcher were transparent and sincere.

73

Microsoft Excel was used to organize information for the study. The use of tables
in Microsoft Word provided the researcher with opportunities to code and analyze data
from each case study (Yin, 2014). Use of a journal by the researcher throughout the
process provided organization and allowed for greater confidence in the results of the
investigation. Participants were asked to reView notes from the interview to ensure
accuracy in reporting; which will also add validity to the investigations (Yin; 2014).
Responses to the research questions including participants’ insights were analyzed and
interpreted and all were combined to form the basis of the conclusions of the study

(Patton; 2002).

Chapter 4: Findings

The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore how school information
professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books
within their organizations. To satisfy the goal of this exploratory research, a multiple-case
study research design was used and data was collected through semi-structured
interviews conducted through Skype or Facetime (Yin; 2014; Hanna; 2012). The
multiple-case study was used to explore perceptions of elementary school librarians (Yin;
2014) through the use of semi-structured interviews (Rowley; 2012). This provided direct
eVidence from elementary school librarians about the changes elementary school
librarians are facing in their library collections.

This study’s interview guide (see Appendix C) consisted of seven open-ended
questions on the topic of exploring how school information professionals perceive the
challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books within their organizations. It
was designed by and standardized by Aharony (2015) in seminal research originally
using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for explaining individuals’ technology
behaviors (Davis, 1989), to predict factors that may inﬂuence information professionals
adopting e-books within their organizations. The objectives of this study were “to
explore”: (a) the extent to which the TAM explains information professionals’ intentions
to use e-books, (b) the extent to which personal characteristics such as motivation and
cognitive appraisal explain information professionals’ intentions to use e-books, and (c)
the extent to which differences in demographic variables such as age and education

explain information professionals’ intentions to use e-books (Aharony, 2014; p. 2).

Aharony’s (2014) study was conducted in Israel during the first semester and used
two groups of information professionals and participants: librarians and information
specialists and used four questionnaires to gather the following data: personal details;
attitudes to e-books, motivation, and a cognitive appraisal (Appendix A). The personal
details questionnaire has four statements. The e-books attitude questionnaire, based on
Liu et al. (2010), was modified for this study from questions rated on a 7 -point Likert
scale (1=strongest disagreement; 7= strongest agreement) to 7 opened ended interview
questions. Principal components factor analysis on the survey statements revealed four
distinct factors. The first related to information professionals’ behavioral intention to use
e-books (items 3; 5; 7 ; 11); the second to information professionals’ perceptions about e-
books’ ease of use (items 1; 8; 10); the third to information professionals’ personal
innovativeness (items 4; 6; 9); and the fourth to information professionals’ perceptions
about e-books’ usefulness (items 2; 12; 13). The values of Cronbach’s Alpha were .82;
.84; .83; and .70 respectively (Ahrony; 2014). Permission to use; adapt and modify the
survey statements to interview questions provided to this researcher by Prof. Noa Ahrony
can be found in Appendix E. Five open—ended interview questions were developed from
the four areas Aharony identified as the principal components of the instrument’s factor
analysis. These questions are listed in Appendix C.

Each participant took an ICT Questionnaire (see Appendix D) to evaluate each
participant’s comfort level with using technology and e-books. The ICT questionnaire
consists of 12 statements rated on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongest disagreement; 5
= strongest agreement). The instructions to the participants were: “Please respond

spontaneously with the first thoughts that come to mind upon hearing the following

76

statements”. This questionnaire was previously used (Shonfeld & Aharony; 2015). The
value for the Cronbach's alpha of the questionnaire was .81. The validity of this study’s
instrumentation depends on the matter of transferability.

The researcher archived raw data and recorded interview sessions as supporting
documentation of the research ﬁndings, and interpretations and generalizations arrived at.
Additionally; a numerical classification system was implemented for identifying
participants on interview documentation and relevant raw materials so as to maintain
confidentiality (Patton; 2002). Transferability is similar to external validity; as both
notions are involved with the amount to which the outcomes of one study can be useful to
other settings (Merriam; 2009).

The focus of this multiple-case study was 7 semi-structured interviews with
public elementary school librarians that were conducted through Facetime and Skype
using an app that recorded the interviews as well as field notes taken during the
interviews. Each of the seven participants satisfied the criteria to participate in the study
and provided opinions; insights; and information about their experiences of including e-
books in their school library collections. Data was collected through in-depth semi-
structured interviews. All participants were females, ranging in age from 32-64 years old.
All but one held masters degrees. All held the position of elementary public school
librarian but five out of seven identified their title as Media Specialist or Library Media
Specialist.

The results of the study and findings with summaries of participants’ responses

are outlined in Chapter 4. The research addressed the following central question:

77

RQ1: How do school information professionals perceive adopting new
technologies such as e-books within their organizations?

The research questions addressed by the results of this study are:

RQ2: How do school information professionals perceive their personal challenges
in the adoption of new technologies such as e-books within their organizations?

RQ3: How do school information professionals perceive the organizational
barriers that challenge their adoption of new technologies such as e-books within their
organizations?

Interview Protocol

The interview protocol included three parts. The first consisted of demographic
questions about gender, age; educational level; and identifying as Librarian or
Information Professionals. The second section was an ICT questionnaire that was
administered as part of the interview to determine the participants’ comfort level with
technology. Participants rated their use of 12 platforms for professional or personal use
from 1=strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. The platforms included: word processing,
presentation (such as PowerPoint); electronic spreadsheet, collaborative platforms such as
Google Docs; social network sites, smartphones or tablet applications, wikis; blogs;
communication systems based on the Internet (such as Skype), media sites (such as
YouTube, simulations software and electronic games or learning management systems
such as Moodle.

The seven open—ended questions were:

1. What do you think are the benefits of e-books?

2. What do you think are the disadvantages of e-books?

78

3. What are your intentions to use e-books in your school library?

4. What do you believe about the ease of using e-books in your school library?

5. What are the challenges facing you in using e-books in your school library?

6. How do you feel about your having to switch to a technology-rich platform in

your school library?

7. How have e-books contributed to your own professional development as a

school librarian?
Findings of the Main Study

Demographics. The demographic section of the interview consisted of questions
about gender, age; education level; and asked whether they were information
professionals or librarians (see Table 1). All of the participants were female. The age of
participants ranged from 32 to 64 years of age (See figure 1). All but one participant held

a master’s degree.

ICT survey. The purpose of the ICT survey was to determine the comfort level of
the school librarians with technology. All participants were asked to rate these programs
from 5 strongly agree to 1 strongly disagree based on this statement: Iuse these platforms
for my professional and personal needs.

The first three questions were applications that can be found in software packages
such as Microsoft Office (see Figure 2). The ﬁrst platform listed was Word. All but one
participant responded with 5 and 1 participant responded with 4 so all participants felt
comfortable with that program. Question 2 Presentation such as PowerPoint averaged
3.58 with participant 6 responding with 1. The other responses were between 3 and 5.
Question 3 Electronic Spreadsheet had an average response of 2.29 with the highest

response a 5 by participant 5. The other participants responded with 3 or lower.

Questions 4 through 8 were about Web 2.0 tools and use of smartphones or tablets
(see Figure 3). Question 4 Collaborative platforms such as GoogleDocs had an average of
3.58. Participant 7 mentioned the use of GoogleDocs in response to an interview
question. Three participants responded with 3, including participant 7. Participants 2 and
5 responded with a 5 with participant 3 responding with a 4. Participant 6 responded with
2.

The participants’ responses to Question 5 social networking sites were diVided.
Participants 1,4, 5, and 7 responded with a 4 or 5. Participants 2 and 3 responded with a 1
and 2 respectively so five of the participants are comfortable with social networking sites

while two are not.

All participants responded with a 5 for question 6 Smartphone or tablet
applications. That means they are comfortable using the type of deVices needed for
reading e-books. Questions 7 and 8 were about the use of blogs and wikis. Participants 2,
4, and 6 responded with strongly disagree for the use of wikis, and blogs. The responses

to Question 7 averaged 1.71 with participant 5 responding with 3, the highest response

82

for this question. Question 8 averaged 2.14 with 5 of the participants, 2,3,4,6, and 7
responding with 2 or less. Participant I responded with a 3 and participant 5 with a 5.

In question 9 Communication systems based on the Internet (such as Skype) the
average response was 2.29. Participant 7 responded with a 4, the highest response while
participants 2, 3, 4, and 6 responded with a 1 or 2. Participants 1 and 5 responded with 3.
This was backed by some of the problems in using FaceTime and Skype for the interviews
with participants. For example, a few interviews had to be rescheduled so that participants
could download the app and learn how to login. Most participants (5 out of 7) responded
with a 4 or 5 to Question 10 Media Site (such as YouTube) so they are familiar with this
type of site and have used it. The other responses were a 2 and a 3 so these two
participants are familiar with sites like YouTube but may not use them much. Question 11
Simulations, software, electronic games includes three different items and some
participants used some of the items list but not others. Reponses to this included every
response listed from 1-5 with one 5, one 4, two 3s, one 2, and two 1s. The last ICT
question was 12. Learning management systems (such as Moodle). Most participants were

not sure about what it was. One participant responded with a 5. There were three

83

responses of 2 and three responses for 1 from the other participants.

Thematic Analysis of the Contextual Data
This section discusses the main themes that have been identiﬁed and described as
a result of the research questions for this study. This section is organized by research
questions with themes that are related to each question. The responses by participants to
the research questions and information from the field notes are provided to support the
research questions.
RQ1: How do school information professionals perceive adopting new

technologies such as e-books within their organizations? Through analysis of the data

84

collected from participants, three themes were identified. The three themes are: (a)
unlimited access to library sources in and out of school, (b) technology better supports
students’ learning of literacy skills, and (c) economically disadvantaged students who do
not own mobile deVices are cut off from unlimited access.

(a) Unlimited access to library sources in and out of school. Several
participants considered their school situations and discussed unlimited access in terms of
the e-books in their collections. When asked about the benefits of e-books Participant 1
stated “If you have multiuse capability more than one person can be using it at the same
time.”

Participant 1 also discussed her intentions to use e-books in her school library. She stated,
“I purchased a few e-books through Follett. Those are multiusers so different classes can
be looking at that book at the same time especially for curriculum needs. So if there are
certain books on the Revolutionary War that are really popular and we have it as
multiuser e-book, different classes have access to it at the same time.”

Participant 2 discussed the benefits of the use of e-books with classes. She stated
that, “Being able to teach group lessons, greater access. All students can use them at the
same time during lessons. They can be projected onto the screen to use for whole group
lessons and the access from home with the unlimited access.”

Participant 3 related that single user licenses can be challenging, “We had an
issue with single user license e-books but unlimited access can solve problems.”

When discussing the benefits of e-books, Participant 4 stated that “[Users] can have
simultaneous access.” Further discussing unlimited access in the school library,

Participant 5 stated, “Well, specifically, we have Abdo Digital Library. They are

85

unlimited access e-books. I paid $25 and received a hard cover and the e-book. All
students can access the same book at the same time. The cost was cheap.” Participant 5
also explained that students were expected to read the e-books outside of the library. She
related, “Our e-books are just for access at home. I'm a prep. They [students] can have a
book [e-book] without borrowing it from the library.
Participant 6 discussed the some of the benefits of the unlimited access e-books.
She stated:
The benefits are that they can follow the students from school to home and back
again. I think you can take it anywhere. If they go on vacation or to a friends
house Its always with them. Ifthey have a deVice or if they have a phone which
most kids these days do have some kind of a smartphone or tablet so I think that’s
nice it goes to different places and follows them easily.
Participant 6 also discussed the reasons why she had not yet purchased e-books
for her school library collection. She explained:
I really haven’t bought any. I mean what I‘d like to see. I’d like to be able to have
tablets or iPads that everyone could be reading books off of those. And kind of
make the library period more focused on them getting their books or reading
something on the iPads [instead of] trying to run around making sure everyone is
logged in or using it correctly. I never got a FollettShelf account. I think I am the
only school [in my district] that does not have an e-book collection.
Participant 7 discussed some benefits of unlimited access. She explained that, “Ifthe
subscription is for at home and at school they can read books at home or at school 24/7.”

Participant 2 related a problem that she encountered at her school with e-books. She

86

explained: Students don’t access the e-books from home although one issue is that Follett
is enabling access to all our public school e-books on the shelf at the same time — some
district e-books from the middle school are seen in elementary — causing a problem with
appropriate materials due to the tech problem.

Several participants mentioned having subscriptions to TumbleBooks, a
subscription service sold as annual licenses that provide unlimited access to several types
of e-books, including narrated storybooks and chapter books (About the TumbleBook
Library, 2015). Participant 4 related, “The only e-books I have are a subscription to
TumbleBooks, It gives us access to 1000 e-books rather than buying that many.”

Participant 5 stated “I have TumbleBooks for special education students to have
books read to or as a read along.” Participant 7 discussed some of the features provided
by Tumblebooks. She related that:

Some of them [e-books] give you quizzes and book reports that you can do. You

can print them as well. It also gives you a score. Some of the software like

TumbleBooks for example, offers them Videos as well as games and puzzles. It

provides an index for them. They can search by title or author. I can use a screen

to have them listen to the story as well as see the pictures and discuss it orally. I

can use it for whole class instruction. Some of the stories give them a choice of

puzzles or games for the vocabulary words. TumbleBooks and other e-books too
have lesson plans tools and resources that correlate with the standards.

TumbleBooks has three languages, French, English, and Spanish.

87

(b) Technology better supports students’ learning of literacy skills. Several
participants discussed learning literacy through e-books in their school setting.
Participant 2 discussed some of the features that e-books can provide. She explained:

We were introduced to a new form of e-book called Lightbox from Follett. Just to

elaborate on the whole added features. That’s phenomenal. I bought 8 books so

far and intend to buy more. They come with hard covered books to go on the
shelf. But the e-books are attached to vocabulary.com the vocabulary from the
book is already there for the students to practice the vocabulary. It is connected to

Google maps built right in so the can actually go and get a 3D View of the terrain

or the area for example, elephants they could use Google Maps and go to African

and see. There’s a lot of added features. They [e-books] have embedded Videos
and they are a great resource in my opinion. I intend to buy more. I incorporate
them into my lessons when we are learning about a topic with my projector with
my students. And then I have them use the e-books themselves to do their
research too. I have 10 desktop computers and 16 iPads so each child has his own
deVice so whatever lesson or unit is we are working on the use the e-books to
conduct their research or to complete their assignments. I intend to continue to do
that and build upon it.

Participant 3 also discussed some features of e-books. She stated that e-books can
provide:

For grades 3“, 4th, and 5th access to content because students are way too busy to

go to the public library. Students can download and read them [e-books] at home.

At school they [e-books] allow for highlighting and note taking from non-ﬁction

88

and for teaching parts of a book for lower grades. For example, showing students

the Table of Contents and index in a book. Participant 3 also stated that e-books

are an: alternate way to access literature. For students drawn to iPads they

provide a way for them to read on a computer — tricks them into reading. The e-

books we have are text only so at my school we are driven to audio books for

younger grades.

Furthermore Participant 3 pointed out some of the differences in e-books that her
students can access. Their school has a subscription to Raz-Kids that provides access to
leveled reading books for elementary students (About Raz-Kids, n.d.). The e-books she
purchased do not narrate and are not interactive. She explained what she observed,
“Under-stimulation when I compared the two. We have Raz Kids [e-book subscription]
with pictures. Compared with them e-books [text only] can be boring — students get bored
quickly.

Participant 5 explained that e-books can be used to introduce writing topics by
providing background knowledge. She related that:

Our district uses a program called Empowering Writers. Part of the program

requires student to write about very specific topics. For example, in one month 4th

graders write about service animals so in the library I am able to introduce the
topics to the students through the use of e-books. All the students can read the
same e-book at the same time. This is for third and fourth grades this year and
next year it will be for fifth grade too.

Participant 5 also created a learning opportunity for students by having them develop

presentations for other students to teach them how to access the e-books. She states, “We

89

were part of a state program for technology and for that I had to teach a technology
lesson. I taught the fourth—graders how to create a Prezi to show other students how to log
on to the e-books.”

Participant 7 also mentioned some of the features of e-books such as: “The sound,
the students can hear it and follow the reading at the same time. They can mute it. They
can read it on their own. It highlights for them. They can make their own selections.”
Participant 7 specifically discussed the use of e-books with younger students for whole
class read-alouds. She explained:

I use the storybooks most of the e-books with small children like K-2 because if

they are not at the reading level they are supposed to be they can still understand

the story. That is a plus. I can use the screen to have them listen to the story as
well as see the pictures and discuss it orally. I can use it for whole class
instruction. In the library they can read independently. I can use it with a screen
and project it as well. They can select their own stories independently once they
login. They can take a quiz or do a puzzle because they can manage that they
know how.

Participant 7 also discussed some of the problems that she observed while using narrated

e-books with students, she related:

One of the disadvantages is it is showing them a lot of pictures sometimes

especially the storybooks so they are not physically reading like when you are

independently reading a book. Most of the time they are listening to the book
being read or read aloud. Other than that I love them. It is not like when you are

reading a book that you have to make an effort to probably learn a new word or

90

use context clues to understand the text because you don’t have pictures there or

you don’t know how to read a word. In the case with the little ones they will

benefit from the pictures. For the little ones it is great.

Participant I mentioned some challenges such as limited number of deVices and
difficulties for older students to read chapter books that require reading over time. She
explained: I do not think they [e-books] are very easy to use. I have only 4 computers and
10 I-Pads. Its very simple for the younger students to use them but for the older students
in reading a chapter book they would have to bring in their personal deVice. That’s when
it becomes a little more difficult.

(c) Economically disadvantaged students who do not own mobile devices are
cut off from unlimited access. Participants 1, 2, and 5, agreed that not all patrons had
deVices or other technology to access e-books. Participant I explained that, “Sometimes
people don’t have a deVice to read them on. You are limited to what your patrons have to
use.” Participant 2 stated that, “Lack of technology as far as not all my students have
access but many of them do but it’s increasingly more at time goes on as we go. They
don’t have access because of poverty. Either they don’t have a tablet or they have deVices
but don’t have Internet. Lack of technology for impoverished children.” Participant 5
related, “You need an electronic deVice to read them and not all my students have access
to them [devices]

RQ2: How do school information professionals perceive their personal
challenges in the adoption of new technologies such as e-books within their

organizations? Analysis of the data identified the two themes that follow: (a)

91

generational perspectives on e-books as opposed to paper books, (b) consequences of e-
Book Technology (such as loss of jobs for librarians).

(a) Generational perspectives on e-books as opposed to paper books. Two
participants related that some school librarians continue to prefer print materials or have a
“lack knowledge” about e-books. Participant 1 stated:

And also as an elementary school librarian, I feel there is something special about

holding an actual book. I think you lose the wonder when you have an e-book as

well as enjoying a story without the bells and whistles. People should be able to
enjoy a plain story as opposed to having to interact with it.
Although Participant 1 stated her feelings about print books above. She has purchased
some e-books. She explained:

We have a subscription to Overdrive and so we are using some e-books. We are

starting to use them. We just purchased e-books throughout the elementary

libraries. They seem to be expensive. All are single use and if we end up losing
our subscription those books are gone that we purchased.

Participant 2 related that not all school librarians embrace e-books, “Lack of
knowledge on the part of our colleagues — other librarians. I whole-heartedly bought into
the use of technology and the use of e-books but I don’t know that all elementary
librarians are doing that.” Participant 4 stated that, “You need a deVice if not available or
working you would not have access to it. If not charged [you] can’t use it. I think it is
easier to read on a physical page and I like the feel of a physical book. You can scan or
reread a print book easier than an e-book.” Participant 4 also related that, “I haven’t used

them [e-books] so I don’t know. You don’t View them easily, lots of steps to go through

92

to access. We don’t have deVices in our school. I can’t see how they benefit us if they
don’t have deVices they can’t read e-books at school”.

Participant 4 mentioned that she consulted with another school librarian in her
district about whether to purchase e-books. She explained:

I have thought of purchasing e-books. I spoke to another librarian in my district

who purchased some. He said the kids are not reading them. Not at this age level

where they are using deVices for reading. The only e-books I have are a

subscription to TumbleBooks, It gives us access to 1000 e-books rather than

buying that many.

Most participants pointed out some of the benefits of e-books as Participant I
explained, “I guess physically there is no wear and tear and you don’t have the weight of
carrying them.” Participant 2 agreed, “Longevity in terms of use. I am looking at my print
books that are falling apart and there are no funds to purchase new ones. My e-books will
be available to my students forever. They’ll last longer too. Participant 5 stated, “No
repairs are needed for books.” Participant 1 brought up the issue that with subscription
purchases or time limited purchases, e-books could become inaccessible to patrons. She
stated, “That sometimes if you have a subscription, if you no longer have a subscription
your e-book might go away. You can’t sometimes own it indefinitely. There could be 24-
month access.”

(b) Consequences of e-book technology Only one participant discussed e-books
in terms of being a threat. Participant 5 stated that “ [They are] a threat to librarians.”
Another participant mentioned that her use of technology is considered positively at her

school. Participant 2 related:

93

Having everything at your fingertips is just amazing. Even my teachers are
starting to appreciate it the more I am able to turn key that information to them.
For example my principal at the staff meeting on Monday my principal was
talking about close reading and haVing the students dig deeper in the research and
writing and reading and comprehension and I got a shout out by one of my fourth
grade teachers. [She] said “my favorite way to do this is from the [school
librarian’s] web site because it is right there. You have the books, you have the
web sites, and access to everything at the students’ level. It’s much more efficient
than when we were young and we had to go out and find stuf
RQ3: How do school information professionals perceive the organizational
barriers that challenge their adoption of new technologies such as e-books within
their organizations? Data analysis revealed two themes for research question three
which follow: (a) limited funding from school districts and (b) allowing mobile deVices
in school keep students out of the library making library purchase of e-books less cost-
effective.
(a) Limited funding from school districts was a concern for several participants.
The limited funds for books but also for technology and technology infrastructure to
support technology were identified and discussed by participants. First, funding for books
will be discussed. Participant 2 explained: “I am constantly trying to build my collection
with the limited funds that we have. Every year I am purchasing more [e-books]. Next to
the high school I don’t know if I have the most but I have 230 something e-books and

continue to add to it.”

94

Several participants discussed the need to purchase or replace print books and purchase e-
books with budget limitations. Participant 2 continued:

The greatest challenge, [the] only challenge that comes to mind is funding. Each

year we are given less and less money in our budget. They are averaging $35 per

e-book. I can build my collection slowly. I have to replenish my print books on
the shelves for the children who are checking books out, which is all of them. The
challenge is to find the funding for collection development. Other than that I can’t
think of any challenges because I have the technology made available to me.

Participant 3 also discussed the need to continue to replace print books as well as
purchase e-books. She explained:

In my situation I replaced a librarian who worked at my school for over 20 years.

I need to keep to the lower end of my budget for e-books because our print books

are really run down. I had to purchase a bundle of e-books with $400 budgeted.

Participant 4 discussed the cost of e-books. When asked about the challenges she
faced in using e-books she related that, “I think that budget — they are more expensive
and you get less for the money.”

Several participants mentioned that there are challenges in having enough deVices
for use in the Media Centers. Participant I explained, “Not enough deVices for all of my
students. That’s the biggest challenge.” Participant 4 also discussed the lack of deVices in
the school library for use in reading e-books. She explained, “I haven’t used them so I
don’t know. You don’t View them easily, lots of steps to go through to access. We don’t
have deVices in our school. I can’t see how they benefit us if they don’t have deVices they

can’t read e-books at school.” Participant 5 related that she too has limited funds and

95

must make choices because she has to continue to purchase print materials while adding
e-books to the collection. She explained:
I have 17 e-books. I have a lack of deVices. There's a lack of funding. I'm in a
school with a new principal and she gave me a book budget. That was the first
time in all my years that I had a book budget. What if she gives me less money?
I'm hoping to get more e-books if I have a budget this year. I'll have to try to
balance between hardcover books and e-books. The company I purchased from
this year had a special this year that made them [e-books] affordable. I'm not sure
if that will be in place again this year. I used to have to get my budget for books
from having Scholastic book fairs.
Participant 5 then mentioned concerns about the cost of e-books, “I don't know the cost
of other e-books so others might be expensive.” In addition to the challenges of adding to
the collection with limited funds, Participant 5 also discussed a lack of funds for
technology for the school library. She stated that: “There is a lack of funds for technology
in the library because we are close to a large urban district. I still do catalo g cards for
books [for book checkouts] and I don't have an automated system. It's all by hand.”
Participant 5 also mentioned that there [is] a lack of deVices in the Media Center for use
with e-books. She relates, “It is not easy. There are not enough computers in the library.
The e-books are strictly for outside of the library.” Additionally Participant 6 discussed a
lack of funds to purchase technology needed for the school library. She related, “I would
say our budgets keep shrinking every year so we don’t have as much money to purchase
technology or what we need.” Participant 6 also discussed some infrastructure issues she

encounters when trying to use technology in her school library. She explained:

96

The technology sometimes doesn’t work as it’s supposed to. I think that’s a really
big deal in our district. A lot of times the signal on the Internet drops if you are
using an iPad or a tablet and its hard to get them back because we only have
limited numbers of spots to be opened for deVices. The signal drops a lot.
Applications freeze and don’t always work right.

Participant 7 discussed a disparity in technology between grade levels at her
school. In grades 3-5 students her students have a one to one with latptops but the other
grades do not have that access. She explains:

I would say that for the little ones I don’t have a set of computers in my library. I

only have 12 working laptops. IfI have the little ones I don’t have enough for

everyone. I have been using the computer and projector with screen for the story.

From 3ml grade through 5th grades the students have laptops in their classrooms

and they bring them to the library and they use them in the library so they are able

to use them. For K-2 they don’t have enough laptops for the whole class. I don’t
have enough in the library for the whole class either. IfI have a special education
class with 7 -10 students then I can use the laptops because I will have one for
everyone.

(b) Allowing mobile devices in school keeps students out of the library
making library purchase of e-books less cost-effective. Some participants mentioned
that although they subscribed to e-books, that the e-books were meant for use outside of
the library. For example, Participant 5 related, “Our e-books are just for access at home.
I'm a prep. They [students] can have a book [e-book] without borrowing it from the

library.” A prep is a preparation period during the day that the classroom teacher has to

97

do work. Students go to specialist area teachers during the teacher’s prep. Participant 5
takes classes while their classroom teachers have their preparation periods. Participant 5
also explained, “It is not easy. There are not enough computers in the library. The e-
books are strictly for outside of the library.”

Participant 2 related that she only sees students in grades 31‘1-5th for 30 minutes
and that is not enough time for them to read e-books and the students are not accessing
the e-books from home. She also mentioned that the vendor that houses her e-books has
not separated the elementary appropriate books from middle school books so her
elementary level students may be exposed to inappropriate material. She explained,

“I want older students [31‘1-5th grade] to use the e-books but I only have time for a 30 min.
class period.” Participant 3 discussed how she teaches students to access e-books from
home but students do not use them from home in spite of her efforts. She relates, “We
have gone tech rich. I teach students how to access e-books 3 times a year and provide
bookmarks with how to log in from home to access e-books but accessing from home —
no. . . . students are in the tech lab reading e-books, at home but accessing from home —
no.”

Evaluation of the Findings

The findings of this study present insights that are supported by the extant
literature and drawn on to address the overarching central research question and sub-
questions. The narrative findings in the research are supported by relevant themes that
were developed from the data outcomes. This section consists of an evaluation that

begins with assessments of the findings, a breakdown within the perspective of each

research question, associated themes, and primary theoretical frameworks.

98

This exploratory case study analysis was guided by the theoretical propositions
(Yin, 2014). TAM used to investigate Library and Information Science (LIS) students’
and information professionals’ acceptance of many different types of technology
innovations by including the intention to use e-books (Aharony, 2013). PEOU and PU,
the determinants of TAM were found to be good predictors of intention to use e-books.
(Aharony, 2014b; Aharony, 2015).

Findings of this study reveal that most school librarians in this study considered e-
books to be useful for Language Arts lessons or to support curricular needs at schools.
Unlimited access books were identified as particularly useful because they allowed for
multiple users at the same time. Findings of this study also reveal that school librarians
were almost evenly diVided about the ease of using e-books in their school library. The
school librarians who responded that e-books were easy to use had enough deVices to
serve full classes while those who did not were lacking enough deVices or had to deal
with technology infrastructure issues. The TAM findings of this study reveal that most
school librarians who took part have behavioral intention to use e-books in their school
libraries. This is indicated in the positive response to the interview question about
whether they intend to use e-books in their school library.

Cognitive Appraisal: Threat vs. challenge is determined by the perception of an
individual of an innovation. Ifthe individual feels threatened, the individual is likely to
avoid the threat. If an individual feels challenged by the innovation, he/she is more likely
to use the innovation (Aharony, 2015). In this case e-books are the innovation, and the
findings of this study reveal that most of the school librarians felt challenged by the

innovation. Only one participant stated that e-books were a threat to school librarians.

99

RQ1: How do school information professionals perceive adopting new
technologies such as e-books within their organizations? An evaluation of the findings
from this study helped to answer Q1. Evaluation of the data revealed three major themes
regarding the how school information professionals perceive adopting new technologies
such as e-books in their organizations. The three themes identified in the findings are: (a)
unlimited access to library sources in and out of school, (b) technology better supports
students’ learning of literacy skills, and (c) economically disadvantaged students who do
not own mobile deVices are cut off from unlimited access.

Unlimited access to library sources in and out of school. Findings from the
study point to most participants considering unlimited access in a positive light.
Decisions about e-book purchases in school libraries are complicated. There are different
models of e-book licenses that determine how e-books are be checked out by library
patrons. Single user access means one patron may borrow the book at a time. This can
mean purchasing more than one copy of a book that is popular. Another type of licensing
that is more expensive but solves this problem is termed, unlimited access. Patrons have
no limits on accessing the book so multiple users can checkout the same book at the same
time (Acevedo & Leverkus, 2014).

The findings reveal that school librarians felt positively about “simultaneous
access” or related that students could, “access the book at the same time.” Participants
related that unlimited access provides: Opportunities for several classes to use the same
book at the same time for curricular purposes, greater access, home access, books could
travel with the student, and students could read the books at home or at school 24/7.

Three participants subscribe to TumbleBooks, a subscription e-book service that provides

100

simultaneous unlimited access with a many different features (TumbleBooks, n.d.).
Participants related that the subscription to Tumblebooks provides access to 1,000 e-
books, has added features such as quizzes, book reports, Videos, puzzles or games for
vocabulary words, lesson plans tools, resources that correlate with the standards, e-books
in three different languages.

The features of e-books are called functionality. Functionality includes the extras
that are added to e-books that enhance their use. This includes specialized features such
as dictionaries, keyword searches, but also information provided in reports on e-books
usage (RonceVic, 2013b). Some newer features allow readers to interact socially by
linking to social networks at specific areas within the books (Ribiere, Picault, & Squedin,
2010). One participant mentioned Tumblebooks subscription was used for her special
education students because the students can have, “books read to or as a read along.”
One participant related unlimited access “ . .. could solve problems” that they had at her
school with single user license e-books.

School librarians must choose the platform that fits their school needs before
purchasing e-books but there are resources available to assist school librarians in making
decisions (RonceVic, 2013c). The many choices are causing school librarians to face
challenges in learning how to purchase e-books because the business models differ
greatly and are more complicated than when purchasing print materials. Librarians
making purchases must take time and care to purchase what is needed for their patrons
(RonceVic, 2013b).

In the findings e-books can present problems that would not occur with print

materials. School librarians had concerns that if subscriptions to a paid service end, then

101

access to the e-books would end. Other concerns were similar for limited license e-books
such as 24-month access e-books and that the subscriptions can end and then access to
that e-book would cease. This does not happen with the purchase of print books although
in the findings school librarians mentioned that print books need to be replaced due to
wear and e-books do not. In order to keep the library collection current and appealing,
librarians must weed out damaged and unappealing print materials (Boon, 2009).

Librarians must take subscription services into account when planning library
purchases. For example, TumbleBooks is an annual subscription service that can end if
not renewed. There e-books that can be purchased for limited time periods as well. When
e-books are purchased for a limited time they can disappear from the collection (Acedo &
Leverkus, 2014). Findings also reveal another issue that would not happen with print
books. The vendor hosting the e-books has placed all of e-books purchased by the district
together. This means that middle school level books can be accessed by elementary
students; exposing young students to inappropriate material.

There are several ways that e-books are packaged. Some e-books are sold as
subscriptions for set periods of time, other e-books become a permanent part of the
library collection, and some e-books are sold as packages that based on the number of
patrons with access to the materials (Sathyanarayana, 2013). There are also rules for how
e-books can be used, for example printing part of the e-book may not be permitted.
Another consideration is whether the e-book is purchased as a one copy license or
unlimited access that allows for many users to access a book at one time (RonceVic,

2013b).

102

Technology better supports students’ learning of literacy skills. The findings
of this study indicate that several school librarians felt that technology supports literacy
skills. Some school librarians mentioned a lack of enough deVices for full classes to use
to access e-books. Another issue revealed by the findings was that for older students who
read chapter books, it would be challenging to read e-books in school unless they could
use their own deVice. Some schools are beginning to allow students to bring their own
deVices to school. Seventeen to 50% of students in grades K-12 own smartphone deVices
with Internet access but many schools ban these deVices due to safety concerns (Grant et
al., 20 15).

The findings also indicate that school librarians felt positively about added
features such as links to outside resources for use as a learning tool. Findings also reveal
that narration, highlighting, and note taking were features in e-books mentioned by
school librarians as useful for teaching research skills or introducing writing topics.
Studies have shown that use of features such as note taking and other text tools can assist
students in writing tasks (Agosto, 2012). Furthermore findings reveal that one participant
discussed a type of e-book she purchased that did not have a narration feature and did not
include pictures was less stimulating for students when compared to e-books that have
pictures and narration. It is important to provide readers choices in multimodal texts to
help engage and motivate them (FelVegi & Matthew, 2012).

When compared to print books, there is a lack of uniformity in the features that
are available in e-books and this is not expected to change in the future (Zucker, Moody,

& McKenna, 2009). The content in e-books often includes interactive features such as

103

narrations, links to more information about a topic, or multimedia enhancements
(RonceVic, 2013b). Thus school librarians need to take care before making purchases.

Findings reveal that school librarians use e-books in their school libraries in many
ways. They use a projector to read e-books during whole class reads aloud. E-books can
provide choices so the student could control the features like narration or use the
highlighting as they read. Struggling readers can be supported by the use of multimodal
e-books that provide tools such as narration, pronunciation, and vocabulary support and
also have images paired with words that assist the young reader with understanding the
text (Morgan, 2016). Using multiple modalities can also be beneficial because individuals
have preferred learning styles and take in information in different ways (Morgan, 2016).
Studies have shown that combining ways information is presented can enhance some
learning capacities but there are not enough studies of whether this benefits students with
special needs or children from low socioeconomic groups (Shamir & Korat, 2015). Some
studies suggest that children with learning disabilities can benefit from multi-sensory
events but they should be tailored or selected to meet their specific experiences and
language (Shamir & Korat, 2015). Students who lack literacy in their homes often have
gaps in early literacy skills which can impede their success in school, but e-books that
highlight the words paired with narration, can help with many of these skills (Shamir &
Korat, 2015). Studies that compared an adult reading of print books to some e-books to
children experiencing the e-books did not acquire as many literacy skills as those
experiencing the book read to them (Shamir & Korat, 2015).

Findings reveal that a disadvantage is that e-books sometimes show students a lot

of pictures especially the storybooks, and so with narration students may not actually

104

independently read a book. Some students are listening to the book being read or read
aloud. In some studies comprehension levels of children using electronic versions of
books when compared to students who read print were greater for those on electronic
deVices (Morgan, 2016). Findings also revealed that when books are narrated students do
not have to use context clues to understand the text. Children who use the tools provided
can benefit from them but sometimes students become dependent on the tools, and cease
to try to decode words on their own (Morgan, 2016).

School libraries by law must find ways to meet the special needs of students who
have been identified as having disabilities. In order to better meet students’ needs school
libraries need to provide access to materials in a wide variety of formats, including e-
books with narration (Subramaniam, et al., 2013). Pairing text with narration or images
that relate to the text can support readers because one part of the brain works with text
and another with images, this dual-channeling aids in learning text or in processing
images (Bus, Takacs, & Kegel, 2015). However, these same features can become
distracting to children and inexperienced readers as well (Moody, 2010). Cognitive
overload can occur when extra images or text that do not relate to the text in the book, are
added to multimedia stories. When readers try to interact with the unrelated information it
can impede readers from comprehending the story. This is particularly true for children
because their brains are still developing and they are not yet able judge which
information is relevant, a form of multitasking (Bus, Takacs, & Kegel, 2015).

Economically disadvantaged students who do not own mobile devices are cut
off from unlimited access. The digital divide still eXists in our country today. It eXists in

three main areas: access to broadband connections, knowledge of digital literacy, and the

105

type of deVices available (Cohron, 2015). The findings of this study support the need to
take the type of access or lack of access of students into account when developing orders
for the school library. The findings show that school librarians are concerned that not all
of their patrons have deVices or other technology needed to access e-books. One
participant explained, “You are limited to what your patrons have to use.” Another
participant related, “ Either they don’t have a tablet or they have deVices but don’t have
Internet. Lack of technology for impoverished children.”

The digital divide is greater for certain groups. Those in rural areas have less
access than those in urban areas. The lower the educational level, the less access. Also
socioeconomics makes a great difference. Forty-nine percent of those who have income
of less than $25000 a year access the Internet at home while for those with an income of
over $100000 the percentage is close to 100%. Less than 20% of those who did not
graduate from high school own tablets while those who graduated from college 46% own
tablets (Dolan, 2016). There is even a digital diVide between schools that serve students
from lower socioeconomic incomes. The students who attend schools in low
socioeconomic areas are more likely to use technology for drills than for creating a
product (Dolan, 2016).

School librarians should be aware of the way students will be connecting to use e-
books. There are a large number of individuals who use mobile technology to connect to
the Internet. This is particularly true for those who are less afﬂuent or non-white (Cohron,

2015) so it is important to take these factors into consideration when making purchases.

106

RQ2: How do school information professionals perceive their personal
challenges in the adoption of new technologies such as e-books within their
organizations?

Analysis of the data identified the two themes that follow: (a) generational
perspectives on e-books as opposed to paper books, (b) consequences of e-book
technology (such as loss of jobs for librarians).

Generational perspectives on e-books as opposed to paper books: The
findings indicate a number of the participants related that some librarians continue to
prefer print materials or have a “lack of knowledge about e-books. Participant I
discussed her preference for a print book. She explained, “I think you lose the wonder
when you have an e-book as well as enjoying a story without the bells and whistles.
People should be able to enjoy a plain story.” In spite of these comments she has
purchased some e-books for her school library.

A School Library Journal survey of school librarians in United States found that
only 20% of elementary and middle school staff and students had access to at least 100 e-
books. The percentage increased to one third for high schools (Farmer, 2011). One reason
for this is that digital collection development decisions have become more complicated
due to the increasing choices of e-book platforms (RonceVic, 2013b).

In contrast, librarians and LIS students in Israel, who used mobile services in
general, were found to have a greater intention to use mobile technology in the library
(Aharony, 2014b). Thus, it is possible that more exposure to using deVices can help

develop greater acceptance in individuals.

107

Consequences of e-book technology (such as loss of jobs for librarians). The
findings indicated that Participant 5 considered e-books to be “a threat to librarians.” In
several different studies of librarians and LIS students Aharony (2013) found that when
adopting new technologies, those who felt threatened were less likely to View adopting
the new technologies in a positive light whereas those who feel challenged are more
likely to accept the new technology (Aharony, 2013). In a study of school libraries in
New Jersey, participants mentioned concerns that budget cuts cause cuts to the school
library programs (Todd, Gordon, & Lu, 2011).

Findings also revealed a rival stance on using e-books and other technology. A
participant discussed that a teacher spoke positively about the efficiency of using her
library web page to access materials at the students’ reading levels. In a study of school
libraries in New Jersey, teachers related that school librarians can teach students to use
leXile levels to locate reading materials on the students’ reading levels (Ross, Gordon, &
Lu, 2011; Gordon, 2013).

Some school libraries have developed almost completely digital collections. In
some schools the physical space was allocated for other uses. In another, the online
school library was fully digitalized. While some school libraries have become digitalized
quickly most have made the transition from print to digital more slowly (Lamb &
Johnson, 2014).

The number of state certified school librarians employed in K-12 schools in the
US. have decrease rapidly to 60% (Ewbank & Kwon, 2015). In some districts positions
are being cut or “deprofessionalized” due to budget cuts and pressures due to testing

(ALA, 2014). Deprofessionalized means that duties formerly held by a certiﬁed librarian

108

are taken over by those who do not hold library certiﬁcations. In response to potential
cuts in school library positions, professional organizations have developed advocacy
tools to prevent the elimination of library positions (Ewbank & Kwon, 2015).

RQ3: How do school information professionals perceive the organizational
barriers that challenge their adoption of new technologies such as e-books within
their organizations? Evaluation of the data revealed three major themes regarding how
school information professionals perceive the organizational barriers that challenge their
adoption of new technologies such as e-books within their organizations. Data analysis
revealed the following two themes for research question three: (a) limited funding from
school districts and (b) allowing mobile deVices in school keep students out of the library
making library purchase of e-books less cost-effective.

RQ3a: Limited funding from school districts. The findings of the study reveal
that school librarians strive to balance replacing or maintaining print materials while at
the same time building a collection of digital materials on limited budgets. In a survey of
school librarians about the percentage of their materials budget spent on e-books, the
average was 5.8% for the year 2013-2014 but 32% of elementary librarians spent 0% of
their budget on e-books.

Findings indicated that school librarians consider the cost of e-books as
expensive. The ﬁndings also reveal that school librarians also face challenges of having
enough deVices for use in their media center for full classes. In a survey of school
librarians in the US. by School Library Journal, 46% identified lack of deVices to read e-
books at home or at school as a hindrance to including them in their collections (School

Library Journal, 2014).

109

The deVices and Internet connections of patrons are important considerations
when making decisions about purchasing e-books. Some students may not have deVices
or Internet to connect to access materials. Several participants related that many of their
students do not have deVices or Internet access.

Findings also reveal that technology infrastructure and support issues can prevent
school librarians from investing in e-books. Another issue is that in purchasing carts of
deVices the technology infrastructure and the technology support must be considered
(Grant et al., 2015).

Findings also show that in some schools there is a disparity in technology
available for specific grade levels. For example, the 3ml -5th grades may have one to one
laptops while the lower grades do not. Sometimes the media center does not have enough
deVices for all students but some librarians use a projector to read e-books with students
when the lack of deVices is a problem. In order to initiate deVice programs teachers need
training to use the deVices and to incorporate them effectively into their instruction
(Grant, et al., 2015).

RQ3b: Allowing mobile devices in school keep students out of the library
making library purchase of e-books less cost-effective. Findings from the study reveal
that some school librarians purchase e-books for their school library collections but do
not use them in their school libraries. Half the school librarians discussed the e-books in
their collections in terms of home use. The reasons stated by school librarians not enough
computers for all students in a class as well as lack of time. School librarians also
discussed the need to provide training to students during class on how to login from home

but she stated that students do not access the e-books from home.

110

Members of the AASL have created standards for student learning that require
students to learn to use resources in varying formats including digital formats (AASL,
2007). In order to meet this standard, school librarians must provide students with
exposure to resources in multiple formats. NBPTS (2012) relates that school librarians
must develop library collections that meet the needs of their schools. Additionally, ISTE
(2012) has developed profiles for technology tasks students of different ages should be
able to accomplish. The profiles for students in pre-kindergarten to second grade states
that they are expected to be able to maneuver through e-books and software.

Summary

The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore how school information
professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books
within their organizations. To satisfy the goal of this exploratory research, a multiple-case
study research design was used and data was collected through semi stmctured interviews
conducted through Skype or Facetime (Yin, 2014; Hanna, 2012). The multiple-case study
was used to explore perceptions of elementary school librarians (Yin, 2014) through the
use of semi-structured interviews (Rowley, 2012). This provided direct eVidence from
elementary school librarians about the changes they are facing in their library collections.

This study’s interview guide (see Appendix C) consisted of seven open-ended
questions on the topic of exploring how school information professionals perceive the
challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books within their organizations. This
was designed by and standardized by Aharony (2015) in seminal research originally

using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for explaining individuals’ technology

111

behaviors (Davis, 1989), to predict factors that may inﬂuence information professionals
adopting e-books within their organizations.

The findings indicate that most of the participants considered unlimited access e-
books as beneficial whether they are part of a subscription or purchase of the title. The
added features were also considered a positive characteristic of e-books, particularly
TumbleBooks. There are concerns about e-book subscription limited access periods.
Most of the school librarians View e-books as a teaching tool, particularly when features
are used. Some school librarians use a projector to teach students using e-books.
Participants actively teach students to login to e-books independently to make decisions
about the features they use. School librarians have concerns that features such as
narration may prevent students from actually reading the story or decoding words but
overall most participants considered e-books as supporting students’ literacy skills.

Some school librarians prefer print books over e-books. In spite of that all but one
school librarian has purchased e-books, or purchased a subscription to e-books for their
school library. Studies show that elementary libraries have fewer e-books than high
school libraries (Farmer, 2011). In order to help school librarians to become more
accepting of e-books, more exposure to e-books might encourage greater acceptance of
this relatively new technology (Aharony, 2014b).

Findings indicate that one participant stated that, “E-books are a threat to
librarians.” Another participant mentioned that using e-books and showing teachers how
to access them prompted positive comments about her at the staff meeting. Studies show
that when an individual feels threatened rather than challenged, the individual is less

likely to View the new technology positively (Aharony, 2013). School library positions

112

have either been eliminated or deprofessionalized across the nation (Ewbank & Kwon,
2015). A few school libraries have gone completely digital or nearly all digital (Lamb &
Johnson, 2014).

Findings reveal that budget cuts are impeding purchases of digital materials.
Some participants said that e-books are expensive. Others mentioned having to maintain
print collections while adding e-books. Several participants also referred to the lack of
enough deVices for full classes in the media center or technology infrastructure issues that
prevent the use of deVices. And yet other participants mentioned disparities in deVices
available to particular grade levels due to one to one laptop programs. The findings of
this study also reveal that school librarians have to balance purchases of digital materials
with print materials on limited budgets. Not all media centers or students have the
deVices necessary to use e-books in school libraries or at home. School librarians use e-
books and technology in teaching language arts skills across the curriculum when

deVices, projectors, and infrastructure are available.

Chapter 5: Implications, Recommendations, and Conclusions

The problem this study addresses is that information professionals continue
dealing mostly with printed materials, and many appear challenged and resistant in
changing their student media centers to be mainly based on digital materials, especially
on e-books (Aharony 2015; 2014b). The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore
how school information professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new
technologies such as e-books within their organizations. This study’s purpose was met by
a multiple-case study that complemented the results of studies that have already been
conducted by other researchers using quantitative methods (Yin, 2014; Aharony, 2015).
The unit of analysis was library professionals who work in public elementary school
media centers that serve students in kindergarten through fifth grade. The qualitative
research method was chosen for this study because of the depth of understanding this
approach can provide for the researcher. Qualitative research seeks to understand the
world or a particular setting from the perspectives of the people liVing in it. This
design enables the researcher to explore differences within and between cases (Yin,

20 14).

The researcher conducted seven in-depth face-to-face individual interviews with
school information professionals at public elementary schools in the state of New Jersey
until saturation was reached. Qualitative data was based on insights derived from in-
depth interviews (Patton, 2002). Since the study concentrated on a specific segment of
the information sector instead of an eclectic sampling, data collection was achieved with
a purposeful sample using a snowball and chain sampling strategy (Yin, 2014). Data was

also collected through the maintenance of ﬁeld notes, archival documentation, subject

114

matter expert examination of and reﬂections on the data (Patton, 2002). Triangulation of
data sources was conducted to establish credibility of the researcher’s reﬂections on the
phenomena under study (Yin, 2014).

The selection of participants was purposeful because the researcher chose those
participants in order to provide access to as many varied school settings as possible
(Patton, 2002). For example, an effort was made to interview school librarians who serve
urban, suburban, and wealthier districts. Additionally, an attempt was made to recruit
school librarians who serve small schools and very large regional schools and who are
located in the northern, central, and southern regions of the state.

Three of the seven participants responded to the post on the LibraryLinkNJ
forums and the others were obtained through the use of snowball sampling. Five of the
interviews were conducted through Facetime and two were conducted through Skype.
The sample consisted of seven females ranging in age from 32 to 64 years old. The
interviews with the participants lasted between 20 minutes to 30 minutes.

There are several limitations of this study. This multiple-case study was limited to
a small sample of siX to eight participants so the data is not discussed in terms of a
sample is discussed in terms of analytic generalizations (Y in, 2015). This study was
dependent on the willingness of participants to donate their time, and lack of time can
impact the quality of responses to interview questions. The researcher made an effort to
schedule interviews at times convenient for the interviewees. There may be some bias or
inaccuracies in the responses of those interviewed but those issues were lessened by use

of corroborating eVidence (Yin, 2015).

115

There is a balance of power during interviews between interviewees and
researchers. This is particularly true if the topic discussed is sensitive so as a novice
interviewer the researcher may ﬁnd these shifts in power challenging which can be
another limitation (Buchbinder, 2011) so the researcher was reﬂective and sensitive to the
power shifts in the interview process.

The risk of reﬂexivity occurring during the interviews was another limitation. The
researcher took care to avoid inﬂuencing responses and guarded against allowing
responses to inﬂuence questioning during interviews (Yin, 2015). Careful writing to
avoid bias and use of voice balanced with analysis assisted with guarding against this
(Patton, 2002).

In the validation process member checking provided interviewees with
opportunities to check the data for correct interpretations and to assist with developing
relationships of mutual respect between interviewees and the researcher (Buchbinder,
2011). Member checking was used at the end of each interview by reviewing questions
and participants’ responses with the interviewee to ensure accuracy of notes taken during
the interview process. But there are some risks inherent in this process because there are
times when member checking is not appropriate, such as when an interviewee becomes
adversarial with the researcher (Cho & Trent, 2006). There was no incidence of
interviewees becoming adversarial during the interview.

Purposive sampling was another limitation because while it provided an
opportunity to investigate information professionals in different settings providing depth
and richness to the investigation, it also limited generalizability of the study and the

researcher was clear in describing the process for their selection (Patton, 2002).

Implications

The speciﬁc problem addressed by this qualitative study is that information
professionals continue dealing mostly with printed materials, and many appear
challenged and resistant to changing their student media centers to be mainly based on
digital materials, especially on e-books (Aharony 2015; 2014b). The purpose of this
qualitative study is to explore how school information professionals perceive the
challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books within their organizations. The
findings and implications were related to each research question addressed below. By
meeting the purpose of this study, this investigation contributed to and continued the
larger scholarly conversation on how school information professionals perceive the
challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books within their organizations.
The findings and implications were related to each research question discussed below.
The implications of this research includes the findings within the context of the study,
which explain their significance and how the results respond to the problem, align with
the study’s purpose, and contribute to the existing literature.

RQ1: How do school information professionals perceive adopting new
technologies such as e-books within their organizations? This question may be
answered from the findings, which showed that school librarians consider unlimited
access e-books in a positive light. Most participants were aware of unlimited access and
were able to articulate positive examples of it. Several participants provided examples of
how they used unlimited access e-books with students. Overall participants discussed
unlimited access as being making e-books more useful. An implication of this study is

that school librarians know about the benefits of unlimited access e-books. Unlimited

117

simultaneous access provides opportunities for more than one patron to use the e-book at
the same time. It is a more expensive model but does make lending materials easier
(Acedo & Leverkus, 2014).

The findings also reveal that unlimited access e-books can also present problems
that do not eXist with print books: Time limited subscriptions to products such as
Tumblebooks will end if not renewed or a subscription to a platform overdrive can end,
causing e-books that were purchased to become inaccessible (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014;
RonceVic, 2013a). An implication of this study is that school librarians need to be aware
of their subscriptions and time limits and take them into account when developing a
budget for the school library collection (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014; RonceVic, 2013a).

Findings also indicate that problems can occur with the way that e-book platforms
that cause books to become accessible to the wrong patrons, expose some patrons to
inappropriate material. The participant who brought up this issue felt that the problem
hindered the use of the e-books in the collection so this problem rendered the e-books
less useful to her school patrons. Implications for this study are that school librarians
need to be proactive on a district, as well as school level so they can have input into
district level decisions about the way their collections are displayed to students. Librarian
can discuss the platform and what is included with the vendor before purchases are made
to find what is the best ﬁt for their patrons (RonceVic, 2013a).

The findings reveal that school librarians felt that technology supports literacy
skills. Most participants related specific ways that e-books could be used to teach literacy
across the curriculum. Some participants solved issues with lack of deVices by using a

proj ector for whole group lessons. Most participants related that e-books were a useful

118

tool. The implications from this study are that most of the school librarians in this study
are very knowledgeable about how e-books and can impact student literacy. School
librarians have adjusted to many new types of materials and resources within their library
collections over the last 100 years, and found ways to incorporate them into instruction
effectively (Lamb, 2015). As more digital resources are added to school library
collection, instruction changes and school librarians can assist with the transition by
facilitating the use of digital materials (O'Connell, Bales, & Mitchell, 2015; de Groot &
Branch, 2011).

The findings also reveal that some school libraries do not have enough deVices for
full classes to use. A few of the participants responded that lack of deVices or
connectivity in their library prevented them from using e-books in their school libraries.
Having enough deVices in schools is a problem reported by many educators (O’Connell
et al., 2016). Implications for this study are that school librarians need professional
development on how to teach classes with a small number of deVices, school libraries
should have enough deVices for all of their classes, or students should be able to bring
their own deVices to school. Bring Your Own DeVice (BYOD) is a program that schools
can implement to allow individuals to use their own deVices instead of or in addition to
what is provided by the school (Dolan, 2016). The findings also reveal that it is
challenging when students read chapter books in schools unless students could use their
own deVices. The implications for this study are that students should be able to use their
own deVices to access digital materials in the school library. BYOD can be an option but

the infrastructure must be able to support it as well as technical assistance for tasks such

119

as adding the deVices to the school Wi-Fi system and other needed support (O'Connell et
al., 20 15).

The findings also reveal that school librarians feel positively about added features
such as links to outside resources for use as a learning tool. Other features are such as
highlighting, note taking and narration were features in e-books that were identified as
useful for teaching research skills or introducing writing topics. Larson (2013) studied
pre-serVice teachers’ use of e-book features and found that some features such as
highlighting and changing font size are useful while other features and less useful. The
implications for this study are that added features of e-books are useful for teaching
research and other literacy skills to students (Agosto, 2012).

The findings reveal that e-books that do not include narration and pictures can be
less stimulating for students than those with pictures and narration. The implications for
this study are that school librarians need to research the digital products they purchase for
their school libraries and perhaps ask for a trial period for some e-books to see if the
features are right for the school (RonceVic, 2013a). School librarians use e-books in many
ways, for example, they use a projector to read e-books during whole class read alouds.
Implications for this study show that school librarians must be ﬂexible when they do not
have enough deVices for all students. In a survey of school staff in Australia, it was found
that in schools that lacked deVices. there was less interest in e-books (O'Connell, et al.,
20 15).

Findings reveal that a disadvantage is that e-books sometimes show students a lot
of pictures, especially the story books and so with narration, some students may not

actually read the book. Some listen to the story being read, aloud. Implications for this

120

study are that students reading e-books need monitoring by adults, including teachers,
parents, and school librarians. Findings also revealed that when books are narrated
students do not have to use context clues to understand the text. Implications for this
study are that students reading e-books need monitoring by adults, including teachers,
parents, and school librarians. Multiple studies have found that adult assistance while
using technology such as e-books improves student learning of many different skills
including emergent literacy skills (Korat, Shamir, & ArbiV, 2011).

The findings of this study support the need to take the type of access or lack of
access of students into account when developing orders for the school library. The
implications for this study are that school librarians should be aware of the technology
available for students at school and at home, and purchase products that are compatible
with those deVices. E-books do not work on all deVices (RonceVic, 2013a). School
librarians are concerned that not all of their patrons have deVices or other technology
needed to access e-books. The implications for this study are that school librarians should
be aware of the technology available for students at school and at home and purchase
products that fit best with what is available (RonceVic, 2013a; Dolan, 2016). Not all e-
books are compatible with all deVices so school librarians must be informed about which
deVices the e-books they are considering purchasing will work (RonceVic, 2013a). The
type of deVices and the access to deVices and infrastmcture as well as the type of
instruction that will occur, impact the decisions that school librarians make when
developing a plan for purchasing e-books (O'Connell, et al., 2015).

Another implication of lack of deVices is that school librarians should purchase e-

readers to lend to students who do not have access to a deVice at home (Leverkus, 2013).

121

In a School Library Journal (2014) survey 92% school of librarians surveyed identified
school owned deVices as the most common way that students accessed e-books. Seventy-
two per cent identiﬁed student deVices as the way that students accessed e-books at
school.

RQ2: How do school information professionals perceive their personal
challenges in the adoption of new technologies such as e-books within their
organizations?

The findings of this study reveal that some school librarians continue to prefer
print materials or have a lack of knowledge about e-books. The implications of this study
are that school librarians may need professional development on e-books because
research has shown that professional development can impact the way teachers use
technology (Dolan, 2016). They may also need to have use of a deVice that will allow
them to use e-books according to Aharony (2014a) who studied librarians and LIS
students’ acceptance of mobile deVices in their libraries. One recommendation from the
study was that supervisors provide training on the benefits of the deVices, and how they
are beneﬁcial in providing services.

The findings indicated that one school librarian who participated in the study
considered e-books to be “a threat to librarians.” In a study by Aharony (2014a) of
librarians and LIS students’ acceptance of mobile libraries, it was found that the more
experience an individual has with a deVice the more likely for it to be positive so
providing opportunities for school librarians to use e-books and mobile deVices may

alleViate some of these fears.

122

RQ3: How do school information professionals perceive the organizational
barriers that challenge their adoption of new technologies such as e-books within
their organizations?

The findings of the study reveal that school librarians strive to balance replacing
or maintaining print materials while at the same time building a collection of digital
materials on limited budgets. Implications for this study are that school librarians should
be informed about free resources available to consortiums, seek assistance from
professional organizations in planning for their library purchases, and advocate for their
school library collection and budget by presenting reports about their current circulation
statistics, including materials that are digital. At this time only a small percentage of
school libraries in the US. are members of consortiums although they can assist with
discounts on purchases of e-books (School Library Journal, 2014). Professional
organizations such as ALA and AASL as well as state level library associations offer
many resources that can support school librarians as they try to develop a digital
collection for their school communities (Leverkus, 2013). There are many models for
purchasing e-books and school librarians must make decisions based on the needs of their
schools. e-book purchases can help students with disabilities and depending on the
features available, they can also be used as assistive technology (Leverkus, 2013;
Subramaniam et al., 2013). E-books have features that allow for searching the text and
assisting with note taking (Leverkus, 2013; RonceVic, 2013a). Some students prefer e-
books to print while other students may prefer print to digital materials (Leverkus, 2013).
Of course training in the use of deVices and e-books is one of the barriers to their use

(Dolan, 2016).

123

Findings indicated that school librarians consider the cost of e-books as
expensive. Prices and packaging of e-book sales to libraries are still evolving as
publishers try different business model (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014). In order to better
understand the e-book market and to obtain information about e-books, school librarians
can use resources provided by their local and national associations as well as list_servs
and discussion boards for school librarians (Leverkus, 2013). It is challenging to compare
prices of print books and e-books because there are many different types of e-books and
different types of licensing for them but using resources such as School Library Journal
reViews may help with decision—making (RonceVic, 2013a; Leverkus, 2013). School
librarians can develop line items in budgets to take care of expenses for e-books, for
example, by paying for platforms such as Overdrive or subscription renewals (Leverkus,
2013). Some newer models of e-book purchases such as patron-driven acquisitions can
provide access to e-books at a school, and purchases would only kick in once the level of
circulation of an e-book reached a specific level (RonceVic, 2013a; Leverkus, 2013).
There are no set guidelines for the number of e-books to be purchased for school libraries
and the lack of research on the optimum choices makes choosing a platform very
challenging for school librarians at this time (O'Connell, et al., 2015).

The findings also reveal that school librarians also face challenges of having
enough deVices for use in their media center for full classes. Implications for this study
are that school librarians need professional development to learn strategies for providing
instruction when one to one use of the deVices is not possible. Organizations such as
ALA, AASL, and state and local organizations provide webinars and conferences to

assist members with acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to manage their school

124

libraries (Leverkus, 2013). Another option is to advocate for BYOD programs (O’connell
et al., 2015). In a survey of school librarians in the US. by School Library Journal, 46%
identified lack of deVices to read e-books at home or at school as a hindrance to including
them in their collections (School Library Journal, 2014). Thus another implication is that
those at the school and district level who make decisions about technology purchases
need to be informed about the potential for enhanced literacy instruction through the
school library. In order to inform stakeholders of technology needs and programs,
training is required (Grant et al., 2015).

Findings reveal that the deVices and Internet connections of patrons are important
considerations when making decisions about purchasing e-books. Several participants
related that many of their students do not have deVices or Internet access. Implications for
this study are that the deVices patrons have, and the type of connection, must be
considered in making purchases, and the school librarian should consider purchasing
inexpensive deVices on which e-books can be loaded and lent to patrons (Leverkus,
2013). In order to make e-reader purchases, school librarians must research which e-
readers will work with the e-books that are circulated in their library collection
(Leverkus, 2013; RonceVic, 2013a). In any BYOD situation there may be students who
do not have deVices, in order to prevent these students from being left out, deVices can be
lent to students (Leverkus, 2013).

Findings also reveal that technology infrastructure and support issues can prevent
school librarians from investing in e-books. Implications for this study are that school
librarians need reach out to their professional organizations for support in purchasing e-

books that are less of a strain on the infrastructure. For example, some e-books can be

125

downloaded to deVices and remain on those deVices for a period of time that is less of a
strain on the infrastmcture than web-based e-books which must be online the entire time
they are accessed (Leverkus, 2013).

Findings also show that in some schools there is a disparity in technology
available for specific grade levels. For example, the 3ml -5th grades may have one-to-one
laptops while the lower grades do not. Sometimes the media center does not have enough
deVices for all students but some librarians use a projector to read e-books with students
when the lack of deVices is a problem. Implications for this study show that school
librarians need professional development to create strategies to provide instruction in
situations where they do not have enough deVices for all students. Professional
organizations provide many resources to support school librarians. There are free
webinars, discussion boards and list_servs available to assist school librarians who would
like to develop an e-book collection (Leverkus, 2013). School principals and district level
decision-makers should keep in mind that in order to initiate deVice programs teachers
need training to use the deVices and to incorporate them effectively into their instmction
(Grant, et al., 2015) and that would include school librarians. Negative attitudes toward
the use of technology can come at every level from the principal, teachers and other staff.
Establishing buy-in from staff is an important factor in a successful implementation of
technology programs (Dolan, 2016).

Findings from the study reveal that some school librarians purchase e-books for
their school library collections but do not use them in their school libraries. Half the
school librarians in this study discussed the e-books in their collections in terms of home

use. The reason stated by school librarians were that there were not enough computers for

126

all students in a class and lack of time. School librarians also discussed the need to
provide training to students during class on how to login from home, but as one
participant related, even with that training students do not access the e-books from home.
Implications for this study are that school librarians need professional development in
strategies for providing instruction to students when one-to-one is not available. There
are webinars and discussion boards that can provide support (Leverkus, 2013). Other
implications are that school librarians reach out to their library associations for advocacy
tools for the library to develop a presentation about the need for deVices in the school
library. The standards for library associations such as ALA and AASL are written in such
a way that school librarians are expected to participate in communication with other
librarians in their districts, as well as their state to share knowledge and information as
well as to network (J ohnson, 2012a).

Members of the AASL have developed standards for student learning that require
students to learn to use resources in varying formats including digital formats (AASL,
2007 ; Johnson, 2012). In order to meet this standard, school librarians must provide
students with exposure to resources in multiple formats. NBPTS (2012) relates that
school librarians must develop library collections that meet the needs of their schools.
Additionally, ISTE (2012) has developed profiles for technology tasks that students of
different ages should be able to accomplish. Students in pre-kindergarten to second grade
are expected to be able to maneuver through e-books and software as part of these

profiles.

127

Recommendations

Recommendations for scholarly research. Recommendations for future
scholarly work on this study topic should include quantitative research that focuses on
school librarians’ acceptance of e-books. This is because although this study provides
detailed anecdotes and rich descriptions of school librarians’ acceptance of e-books in
their school library collections, it was limited in scope and size. Combining quantitative
data with qualitative data would provide breadth and depth to the study variables.
Additionally, a limitation of this study was that all participants were females, and
studying both genders may provide further insights into possible gender differences in
acceptance of innovations.

Recommendations for practice. The findings of this study indicate that
unlimited simultaneous access provides opportunities for more than one patron to use the
e-book at the same time. It is a more expensive model but does make lending materials
easier (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014). The findings also reveal that unlimited access and
other e-books can also present problems that do not eXist with print books: Time limited
subscriptions to products such as Tumblebooks will end if not renewed, or a subscription
to a platform overdrive can end, causing e-books that were purchased to become
inaccessible (Acedo & Leverkus, 2014; RonceVic, 2013a). A recommendation is that
school librarians need to be aware of their subscriptions and time limits and take them
into account when developing a budget for the school library collection (Acedo &
Leverkus, 2014; RonceVic, 2013a).

Another finding is that some library platforms for e-books present all materials

from a district in the same place. A recommendation is for school librarians to be

128

involved in discussing how the materials will be displayed by having discussions with the
vendors so that the product fits the library (RonceVic, 2013a). The findings reveal that
most school librarians see the value of e-books as a useful tools teaching literacy and
other skills, and for the last century school librarians have adjusted to innovations as they
have become available. Recommendations are for school librarians to continue to
facilitate the use of innovations by classroom teachers and students in learning
(O’Connell, 2015; de Groot & Branch, 2011).

The findings reveal that some school librarians purchase e-books but do not use
them in their school libraries. Recommendations are that school librarians participate in
professional development provided by national, state, and regional organizations such as
ALA, AASL, and ISTE about instmctional strategies for use of e-books within their
school libraries. School librarians must strive to keep current in their professional
practice and should model new instructional strategies for their school community (de
Groot & Branch, 2011).

The findings reveal that some school librarians do not have enough deVices in
their school libraries for students to use in the library, preventing the school librarian
from using e-books for instruction. The ﬁndings also indicate that in order to read chapter
books that are e-books, students may need to use their own deVice. One recommendation
is for districts and schools to permit students to BYOD in the school library so that
students can download books to their own deVices for reading at home O’Connell et al.,
(2015). This is especially important for those students who do not have wi-fi at home.

Another recommendation is to have deVices that can be loaded with e-books that students

129

can borrow because even in a BYOD situation some students would not have access to
digital material because they do not own deVices (Leverkus, 2013).

The findings indicate the school librarians feel positively about e-book features
such as highlighting, note taking, narration and that e-books without those features can be
less motiVing for students. Findings also indicate that sometimes students rely on features
such as narration instead of trying to decode words for themselves using context clues.
Recommendations for use of e-books is that is that adult assistance is important
especially for those students developing emergent literacy skills (Korat et al., 2011).

Findings reveal that there is a need to take the type of access or lack of access of
students into account when developing orders for the school library. The recommendation
is that school librarians need to be aware of the types of deVices students have and
whether Wi-Fi is available. This information must be taken into account when making
choices about the type of e-products to purchase (RonceVic, 2013a). The infrastructure of
the school, type of deVices at school and the way the e-books will be used in instruction
also must be considered as part of the plan for purchases of e-books (O’Connell et al.,
2015; RonceVic, 2013a) is another consideration.

Conclusions

The use of digital books increased dramatically after Amazon released the
Kindle, an e-book reader in 2007 (Connell et al., 2012). Many different deVices including
cell phones can be used to access and read e-books (Depollo, et al. 2011). Acquisitions of
e-books in school library media centers have lagged behind public libraries in the number
of books in their collections (Library Journal, 2013; School Library, 2013). School

library professionals serve as information gatekeepers within the organizations (Aharony,

130

2014b). Purchasing digital resources is complicated because business models for
purchasing e-books are very different compared to business models for print materials;
which adds to the challenges information professionals face (RonceVic, 2013b).

There is a need to study this topic in various contexts and through the use of
qualitative methods (Aharony, 2015). The problem is that information professionals
continue dealing mostly with printed materials, and many appear challenged and resistant
to changing their student media centers to be mainly based on digital materials, especially
on e-books (Aharony 2014a; Aharony, 2014b). The purpose of this study was to explore
how school information professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new
technologies such as e-books within their organizations. This study is significant because
it provides insights into the perceptions of information professionals that work at K-5
schools toward including e-books in their school media center collections.

E-books require technology deVices to be accessed and school librarians must
consider how their students will access them (RonceVic, 2013b). Digital resources can
provide tools that can improve students’ success in acquiring skills, but in order for this
to happen school librarians must be willing to add them to the collection (Korat, 2010;
Lin, 2010; Moody, 2010; Moody et al., 2010; Shamir & Shlafer, 2011). There are
professional development resources available through their professional organizations
that can assist school librarians with acquiring skills to integrate digital resources such as
e-books into their library collections (Johnston, 2012a; Leverkus, 2013).

It was important to investigate how school librarians feel about accepting e-books
in their school libraries. Aharony (2014a) used TAM to study factors inﬂuencing how

information professionals in Israel adopt e-books. This model has been used to

131

investigate the factors that inﬂuence library professionals’ adoption of e-books and other
technology innovations (Aharony, 2015). This qualitative research study involved
multiple-case studies with the primary data, semi-structured interviews through Skype or
Facetime. Triangulation of the data through sources of eVidence added to the validity and
reliability of the study. Participants were recruited through a fomm and email. Purposeful
and snowball sampling were used to acquire participants for this investigation from
school library settings within the state of New Jersey. The primary limitation is that the
study was restricted to a small sample of seven participants so the data was not discussed
in terms of a sample but in terms of analytic generalizations (Yin, 2015).

Microsoft Excel was used to organize information for the study. The use of tables
in Microsoft Word provided the researcher with opportunities to code and analyze data
from each case study (Yin, 2014). Use of a journal by the researcher provided
organization and allowed for greater confidence in the results of the investigation.
Participants were asked to reView notes from the interview to ensure accuracy in
reporting, which also adds validity to the investigations (Y in, 2014). Responses to the
research questions including participants’ insights were analyzed and interpreted and all
were combined to form the basis of the conclusions of the study (Patton, 2002).

This study consisted of seven open-ended questions on the topic of exploring how
school information professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies
such as e-books within their organizations. It was designed by and standardized by
Aharony (2015) in seminal research originally using TAM for explaining individuals’
technology behaviors (Davis, 1989), to predict factors that may inﬂuence information

professionals adopting e-books within their organizations.

132

The findings indicate that most of the participants considered unlimited access e-
books as beneficial whether they are part of a subscription or a purchased title. Added
features were also considered a positive characteristic of e-books. There are concerns
about e-book subscriptions limited access periods. Most of the school librarians in this
study View e-books as a useful teaching tool, particularly when features are used,
although some have concerns that features such as narration may prevent students from
actually reading the story or decoding words. Some school librarians continue to prefer
print books over e-books, yet all but one school participant has purchased e-books or a
subscription to e-books collection. More exposure to e-books might encourage greater
acceptance of this relatively new technology among school librarians (Aharony, 2014b).

Findings reveal that budget cuts are impeding purchases of digital materials.
Several participants mentioned having to maintain print collections while adding e-books
and other digital materials to their collections. Participants also mentioned lack of enough
deVices for full classes in the media center, or technology infrastructure issues that
prevent the use of deVices. BYOD programs may help alleViate this but there is still a
digital diVide and school librarians would have to find ways to address it (Leverkus,

20 13 ).

Future scholarly studies could explore whether gender plays a role in acceptance
of innovations. Other areas for study could include whether providing personal access to
deVices plays a role in acceptance of the deVice. Further studies could also explore
whether having enough deVices in the media center has a positive impact on acceptance

of e-books.

133

Elementary school librarians are faced with many challenges as they deal with
changes in their school library collections and their changing role due to increased need
to include digital materials in their school library collections. They will need continued
support from professional organizations and institutions of higher learning. They also
need support through increased budgets, deVice acquisitions or BYOD policies from their

school level and district level administrators.

Appendix C: Introductory Letter
School Librarians’ Perception of Adopting E-books in their School Media

Centers: A Multiple-case Study

Re: Introduction and request for your participation
Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Suzanne Martin and I am a doctoral student at Northcentral University (Prescott
Valley, Arizona). I am leading a research study to explore how elementary school information
professionals perceive the challenges of adopting new technologies such as e-books within their
organizations.

The interview should take about 30 min to complete and your responses will remain conﬁdential.
You will be asked seven (7) questions during the interview. Follow up questions may be asked to
seek for additional information.

If you are available for an interview, please reply Via e-mail S.Martin0763@email.ncu.edu or
reach me by phone at 609 558-5155.

Best regards,

Suzanne Martin, Doctoral Candidate

Northcentral University

Daphne Halkias, Ph.D., Dissertation Committee Chair
