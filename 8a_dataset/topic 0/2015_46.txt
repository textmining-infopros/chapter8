ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION

Top Management Teams in Academic/Research Libraries: Their Jobs; Their

Responsibilities; Their Futures

This dissertation examines the extent to which chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) in
academic and research libraries are involving their top management team (TMT)
members in strategic decision making that affects organizational performance, and,
the extent to which this involvement is preparing top managers to assume
leadership positions as CEOs. This is a critically important question because the
current leadership in libraries is ageing out and unless knowledge, skill and ability
transfer is taking place within today's academic and research library environment,
the next generation of leaders will be at risk of losing the opportunity to incorporate
the cumulative knowledge and experience of their predecessors into their

leadership portfolios.

Strategic decision-making is one of the most important aspects of a top executive's
job. To better understand the dynamics taking place within top management teams
that inﬂuence strategic decision-making, and top managers' roles in strategic
decision making processes in libraries, 34 top managers and their CEOs from
academic libraries were interviewed on the dynamics surrounding strategic
decision making in their organizations. Semi-structured interviews were carried out
with participants. The results shed considerable light on the richly nuanced
relationships that top managers have with one another and with the CEO and how
these relations impact strategic decision-making. The study also revealed
demographic characteristics of top managers that are related to strategic decision
making within the TMT. Key strategic decisions that TMT members were involved in
and their role in the decisions were examined in relation to the strategic issues that
CEOs pointed to as important. A comparison 0fthese citations revealed a series of
variables that inﬂuenced co-citation of strategic issues by both CEOs and TMT

members.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Top Management Teams in Academic/Research Libraries: Their Jobs; Their
Responsibilities; Their Futures

"The burning cry in all organizations is for "good leadership" but we have
learned that beyond a threshold level of adequacy it is extremely difﬁcult to
know what good leadership is. The hundreds of scientiﬁc studies of this
phenomenon come to one general conclusion: Leadership is highly variable
or "contingent" upon a large variety of important variables such as nature of
task, size of the group, length of time the group has existed, type of personnel
within the group and their relationships with each other, and the amount of
pressure the group is under. It does not seem likely that we'll be able to
devise a way to select the best leader for a particular situation. Even if we
could, that situation would probably change in a short time and thus would
require a somewhat different type of leader." (Perrow, Charles. "The short

and glorious history of organizational theory. "Organizational Dynamics 2.1
(1973): 3-15. (p. 13)

Background and Statement of the Problem
Libraries within the academy today are undergoing tremendous change. Forces
within and beyond the university are challenging libraries' roles as time-honored
citadels of knowledge. The future of libraries as collaborators with academic
partners and as centers for scholarly inquiry rests in no small part on the skills,
knowledge and abilities that the next generation of creative individuals will bring to
guide academic libraries through these tumultuous times. Will library organizations
produce these leaders? If so, how will they accomplish this? Moreover, how and to
what extent are today's library executives 'bringing along’ top managers to become
the next generation of academic library leaders? Are today's executives preparing

astute managers to assume executive leadership positions in tomorrow’s academic

library enterprises? These questions are critically important for several reasons.
First, the current crop of academic/research library executives is 'ageing out'. Who
will replace them? Second, libraries are undergoing a fundamental shift in the role
they play within the academy. The value proposition libraries have traditionally
brought to academic work is shifting from that of being a repository ofprint
knowledge to one of mediating access to digital resources. Third, competition from
the private sector is growing and growing fast. With the rise of powerful
information utilities and the burgeoning matrix of peripheral tools that assist
individuals in managing, manipulating, repurposing and personalizing digital
content, the traditional role of the library as chief information purveyor is being

disrupted. Leaders are needed to guide libraries into this uncertain future.

Purpose of the Study and Research Question
To help understand and address these challenges, this research examines how the
dynamics within top management teams in academic research library settings
inﬂuences strategic decision-making, organizational performance and leadership
development, and how this work supports the thesis of this research project, which
is that library executives do in fact involve their top management teams in strategic
decisions to enhance organizational performance, and this involvement serves as
'on-the-job' training to groom top management team members for future leadership

positions as library directors.

The research question, 'To what extent are chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) in
academic and research libraries involving their top management team (TMT)
members in strategic issues that affect organizational performance, and, the extent
to which this involvement, when present, is preparing top managers to assume
leadership positions as CEOs?’ is one that has only been occasionally addressed in
the library literature. Hernon and Rossiter (2 007) provide a glimpse into the
importance of strategic decision-making in their interviews with key library
directors. In their work, Vice Chancellor for Information Technology and Dean of
Libraries at Washington University, Shirley K. Baker cites, "Vision, courage, and
making difﬁcult decisions..." as key aspects of effective executive leadership. (p.79).
Equally important to the success of the academic library is alignment of the library's

strategic goals with those of the university.

The importance of involving top managers in strategic work and aligning that work
with university priorities is well-expressed by Steven Bell, Director of the Library at
Philadelphia University, who observes, "As director, I must make the final decision
on what initiatives we take and what resources we put into them. But that does not
happen in a vacuum" (89). Terrence Mech, Director of the Library at Kings College,
sums up the importance of top management team decision making, noting that,
"There is a danger to having the director as the only library leader...all leaders need
a 'reality check' on occasion that helps them stay in tune with themselves, the
library, the institution, and various constituencies. Over time, perspectives need to

be recalibrated because of fatigue, exuberance, or the blind pursuit of a Vision"

(p.95). Mech suggests that, for a library to be successful, "it means developing
individuals who are comfortable with ambiguity and who ask the big questions, like
why, and how, and what if” (p. 95). He concludes that top leaders must understand
that their Views do make a difference in shaping the library's strategic direction, and
'its success and renewal.’ Sarah Pritchard, Dean of Libraries at Northwestern,
articulates the dynamic role of leadership at the top of the organization: "The
director is the lightning rod, the lead advocate, the one that will take the risks and
make the hard decisions...however, we must also be growing the next wave of
leaders who can help us and take our places, either at our present institutions or
elsewhere. The library is too complex to have only one person who understands it;
so I place a lot of emphasis on professional development ofAULs (top management
team members) and department heads and in getting them involved in campus wide
and consortial work" (p. 107). Hernon (2007), sums up the Views of those
interviewed with the following statement: "Critical to the future of academic
librarianship is the hiring of librarians who can ﬁt comfortably into this [complex
and changing] environment and who do not View work within a narrow context."
Leaders of tomorrow's academic libraries must "concentrate on strategic directions,
the larger environment, and how the library helps the institution accomplish its
mission" (p. 108). Thus, the focus of this research is to examine the extent to which
this training is taking place within top management teams in today's academic

libraries.

Given the importance of this topic for the future of academic libraries and
librarianship, an ethnographic research method was selected as the best means of
gathering rich data on the interactions within top management teams related to this
issue. Semi-structured interviews were carried-out by the author to gather data
from 34 participants who kindly agreed to be interviewed. The participants, who
were selected from 6 research libraries, were library directors and their top
management teams. The operationalization of the research thesis, suggested
considerable emphasis be placed on strategic decision-making as a critically
important aspect of leadership development and how this takes place within the top
management team. Thus, considerable data ﬂows from this question. In particular,

emphasis is placed on examining:

a) The extent to which there is agreement between top managers and their CEOs on

issues each group Views as strategically important for the organization,

b) The promotion of managers who cite issues in common with their CEOs, and

c) Co-citation of strategic issues by top managers who have tenures in common.

These aspects of strategic decision-making in the top management team shed light

on the extent to which top managers and CEOs see 'eye to eye' on issues of strategic

importance. A shared Vision among TMT members and CEOs on issues Viewed as

strategically important may be an indicator that top managers are being exposed to

and involved in the types of issues that prepares them to assume executive

leadership positions in academic libraries.

This research also considers important demographic data regarding the top
management teams studied (e.g., their size, composition, frequency with which they
meet, and other pertinent group and individual characteristics). Findings indicate
that these demographic variables have important inﬂuences on strategic decision
making within the TMT.

Rationale and Signiﬁcance
The rationale for this study is that there is an explicit need, articulated in the library
literature, for libraries to train tomorrow’s library leaders (Hernon, 2002, 2007).
The chiefreasons cited for this are: 1) a signiﬁcant percentage oflibrary CEOs will
be retiring soon1, and 2) libraries, librarians, and library users needs, expectations,
and perceptions are changing, and leaders are needed who understand these

changes and can respond to them.

The significance of this research is that it focuses on the individuals within top
management teams who are poised to assume executive leadership positions in the
future and to understand if they are receiving the training needed to effectively step

into tomorrow’s academic library environment and provide the leadership

 

1 Atopic of perpetual concern among library directors and university administrators is succession planning (Bridgland, 1999;
Curran, 2003; McCarthy, 2005, Galbraith, 2012). Within the community of academic library directors (library CEOs)
specifically, concern is raised every generation or so over who will succeed them and the type of knowledge, skill and ability
they will need to possess. Indeed, within the literature on organizational management there is much written on the value of
mentoring talented managers to assume leadership roles. Succession planning programs are promoted as ways to maintain
business continuity in the face of demographic changes, including retirements of top managers.

necessary to meet the challenges up ahead. It is the purpose of this study to provide

insight into this question while also identifying areas for future research.

Terminology
Certain terms and abbreviations are used in this research project that may be

unfamiliar to the reader. A brieflist of these terms is provided:

TMT — Top Management Team: The group that is composed of the library director

and those who report to the library director.

Top managers — Refers to those individuals who are considered members of the Top

Management Team, minus the director of the library.

CEO — Chief Executive Ofﬁcer — In this study the CEO is the head of the library (e.g.,

the dean of libraries, etc.)

Organization of the Dissertation
This dissertation is organized into chapters and each chapter contains a series of
topics that are addressed in detail. A brief introduction precedes each chapter. To
assist the reader in navigating the contents of this study, a brief synopsis of what

will be covered is offered below:

Chapter 1: Introduction

Chapter 2: Literature Review

This dissertation draws upon three bodies of scholarly work to address the research
question. These streams are: strategic decision-making, organizational theory, and
the library leadership literature. Select works from these bodies of literature are
discussed fully within the literature reView section below and subsequently referred

to throughout the dissertation.

Chapter 3: Design ofthe Study/Methodology

This section presents the design of the study, its participants, key research
questions, and the research method used to collect and analyze data. An
ethnographic approach to data gathering was used for this study in which 34 top
managers and their CEOs from six academic/research libraries were interviewed on
strategic decisions made in their libraries during the past three years. A series of
follow up questions were asked of participants for each of the strategic issues
identified. These included, for example, how the issue came to their attention, their
role in the decision, their degree of satisfaction with the decision outcome, the
degree of inﬂuence they felt they had on the outcome, and identification of others

who were involved and their perceived roles.

Chapter 4: Findings
This section contains responses to two sets of questions asked of participants. (See
Appendix 1, Interview Schedule). The first set of responses pertains to the library

organization, individuals who on the library's organization chart are considered to

be on the top management team (T MT), the frequency of meetings of the TMT, and
other demographic characteristics of the TMT. A second set of responses pertains
specifically to strategic decision-making within the TMT. The strategic issues
identified by participants are presented in a series of tables and common themes
identified. Co-citation of strategic issues by top managers is specifically noted and
suggested as an indicator of cognitive alignment within the top management team
on issues of strategic importance. Demographic data are also presented with brief

co mmentary.

Chapter 5: Discussion

This chapter considers findings drawn from the data gathered in Chapter 4 and in
particular how these data address the central thesis of this research that CEOs are
bringing along top managers to assume positions of leadership through
participation in strategic decision-making in the library. An introduction to
organizational types is followed by a discussion of strategic decisions reported by
TMT members. A discussion of strategic decision-making follows in which some
background and commentary is ﬁrst offered on the emergence of business concepts,
such as strategic planning, and their application in academic settings. This backdrop
provides a context for several examples drawn from this study that place strategic
decision-making within the context of the library. A section follows in which aspects
of the decision making process are discussed, such as 'inﬂuence' 'satisfaction' and
'co-citation' of strategic issues by one or more members of the TMT and the CEO.

The discussion next turns to measures of success and metrics used by top managers

and CEOs. A brief discussion of aspects of the TMT such as identity, interactions,
team building strategies and composition, are next offered to provide some

perspective of the cultural context in which top managers operate.

Chapter 6: Conclusion

The final chapter of the dissertation offers further commentary on how the findings
of this research provides insight into the research question and how these might
contribute to the field of library leadership. Limits of the study are identified
followed by some reﬂections on new areas of inquiry that are opened up by this

study.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
Introduction
This research draws on several important streams of literature to address the

research question of this study, which is:

To what extent are chiefexecutive oﬁicem [CEOS] in academic and research libraries
involving their top management team [TMT] members in strategic issues that aﬁect
organizational performance, and, the extent to which this involvement, when present

is preparing top managers to assume leadership positions as CEOS?

Since strategic decision-making is a core aspect of a top manager's work, some time

is devoted to examining the literature pertaining to this topic. While much of this

10

literature is drawn from scholars who study decision-making in a variety of public
and private settings, corporate examples within bureaucratic organizations
predominate this stream of literature. Of particular relevance to this study on
library leadership is the literature that examines strategic decision-making within
top management teams, and especially the interactions between CEOs and their top
managers. This perspective, known as upper echelon theory, is particularly relevant
for this study as academic libraries are increasingly engaged in group deliberation
and decision-making. Upper echelon theory provides a useful frame for examining
and understanding the nuanced interactions that take place between and among
top managers and how these interactions impact decision-making. It is especially
useful in understanding ways in which CEOs execute strategic decisions based on
the often limited or incomplete information they have available to them.
Additionally, within the context of the literature on strategic decision-making,
particular sub topics (e.g., the particular roles of CEOs in top management teams, the
effects of top management team and CEO tenure on decision-making and
organizational performance, the effects of diversity within the top management
team on performance outcomes, and conﬂict and conﬂict management within the
top management team) are examined. These perspectives inform this study by
identifying variables that inﬂuence interactions between top managers that

ultimately affect strategic decision-making.

11

Closely connected to scholarly work in the field of strategic decision-making is the
literature on organizational theory. This field is quite complex, and much of the
literature is not directly relevant to this study. There is, however, a small but
significant segment of this literature that pertains to organizational demography
(the study of the human behavior within organizations) that is directly relevant to
this research. It is important because this study is about the individuals within
organizations who make up the top management team. This necessarily requires
looking at demographic issues such as age, tenure, and heterogeneity but also at a
top manager's promotion history, agreement within the top management team on
issues of strategic performance, individual Views on roles, success and inﬂuence.
Within the organizational demography literature, there is research that links such
demographic variables to performance outcomes. While it is not the purpose of this
research to provide empirical data on these characteristics and their effect on
performance outcomes, this research does hope to identify demographic
characteristics (e.g., time in tenure, education level, age, gender) at play within the

organizations that relate to decision-making within the top management team.

The literature on libraly leadership both informs this study and provides a
situational base for this research and its ﬁndings. The core literature on library
leadership falls into three groups. The first is characterized by studies that draw
together the attributes library directors View as important for future leaders to
possess (Hernon, 2 001, 2 002, 2 003, 2 006, 2 007). The second includes key studies

of those outside the library sphere, such as university provosts and presidents, and

12

their perceptions of the library (Lynch, 2001, 2007) and surveys of the knowledge
skills and abilities drawn from job postings for library directors. A third stream of
literature, which is just beginning to emerge from the field, comes from managerial
leadership, which is "a process exercised by managers towards the members within
the organization with the purpose of attaining the designated goals" (Babiak, in
Hernon 2007, p.154). Hernon (2 007) adds that managerial leadership might best be
Viewed as the temperament, character, personality, behaviors, knowledge, skills and
abilities required to excel as a manager. It is the "dynamic relationship between
leadership and management" (p. 255). This literature is tremendously useful in
providing background on the aspects of library leadership that have been studied to

date, and future directions the field is taking.

Strategic Decision Making
Strategic decision-making in organizations is deﬁned by Mintzberg, et. al. (1976) as
being "important in terms of the actions taken, the resources committed, or the
precedents set" (p. 246). Eisenhardt and Zbaracki (1992) note that strategic
decisions are "those infrequent decisions made by top leaders of an organization
that critically affect organizational health and survival" (p. 17). Strategic decision-
making within organizations is inﬂuenced by a variety of factors that range from the
internal and external environment, to organizational structures, to the demographic
characteristics of individuals within the organization. The effectiveness of decision
making is also variously Viewed through, for example, the lens of complexity (Stacy,

1995) who argues that "organizations are systems in which long term outcomes are

13

the result of the entire history of an organization, not a single action or decision"
(Mador, p.3) or from the perspective posited by Eisenhardt (1997) that
"improvisation is a relevant metaphor to describe strategic management" (ibid. p.3).
The various characteristics that deﬁne successful strategic decision making include
measures of 'comprehensiveness' or 'the extent to which strategic options have
been sought and evaluated' and 'extensiveness' which "measures the extent to
which the process considers long-term opportunities and threats in the

environment" (ibid. p.4).

While considerable research has focused on the strategic decision making aspects of
CEOs (Cyert and March, 1963; Mintzberg, 1976; Kotter, 1982) Hambrick and Mason
(1984) argued in their paper on upper echelon theory that the characteristics and
behavior of top management team (TMT) members affects organizational strategy
and performance. Challenging the View that organizations are 'swept along’ by
inertia (Hall, 1977), the upper echelon theory, which is drawn from the Carnegie
School whose theorists argue that "complex decisions are largely the outcome of
behavioral factors rather than a mechanical quest for economic optimization'"
(Hambrick and Mason, 1984, p. 194), upper echelon theory argues that
organizational outcomes are 'partially predicted by observable managerial
background characteristics.’ Examples of these include age, tenure in the
organization, functional background, education, socio-economic roots, and ﬁnancial
position. Not explicitly included in the upper echelon theory are psychological

processes (Lawrence, 1991) that identify interactions 'between managers, systems

14

and the environment' that affect strategic decision-making. Hambrick and Mason's
theory generated a list of propositions to 'stimulate empirical inquiry’ into upper
echelons within organizations which are frequently cited and critiqued. For the
purposes of this study on top management teams in libraries, tenure in the

organization is examined as a variable affecting strategic decision-making.

Strategic Decision-Making: Upper Echelon Theory

Upper echelon theory, as described by Hambrick and Mason, "attributes major
inﬂuence to ﬁrms' leaders' in crafting organizational strategy (Finkelstein,
Hambrick, 1990, p. 485). It claims that: 1) executives act on the basis of their
personalized interpretations of the strategic situations they face, and 2) these
personalized constructs are a function of the executives' experience, values, and
personalities. The theory is based on the concept of'bounded rationality' that,
"informationally-complex, uncertain situations are not objectively knowable but,

rather are merely interpretable" (Hambrick, 2007, p.334).

Upper Echelon Theory also examines the attributes and the demographic
characteristics of top management teams, and the collective effects of team
members on strategy and organizational performance. Hambrick (2 007) notes
"Leadership of a complex organization is a shared activity, and the collective
cognitions, capabilities, and interactions of the entire top management team enter
into strategic behaviors" (p. 334). It is this dominant coalition ofthe CEO and top

managers that collectively shapes organizational outcomes. A variety of

15

demographic factors inﬂuence behavior within the coalition. For example, the
inﬂuence of top management team heterogeneity on organizational performance
(Hambrick, Cho, Chen, 1996), the inﬂuence of external ties of top management team
performance (Geletkanycz, Hambrick, 1997), and the effects of diversity within top
management teams on organizational performance (Simons, Pelled, Smith, 1999;
Nielsen and Nielsen, 2013). Moderating factors, such as managerial discretion and
executive job demands (Finkelstein, Hambrick, 1990; Hambrick, 2007), the role of
uncertainty (Mason, Frederickson, 2001), the political skills of the CEO (Ahearn,
Ferris, Hochwarter, Douglas, Ammeter, 2004), behavioral integration of top
management teams (Raes, Bruch, Delong, 2012), and the interface of top
management teams and middle managers (Raes, Heijltjes, Glunk, Roe, 2011) serve
to further illustrate the operational aspects that define the upper echelon theoretical
model. While the noted research as a whole provides fascinating insight into some
of the dynamics operative within the top management team, Hambrick's work on
the inﬂuence of top management team heterogeneity on performance (1996) is
particularly relevant for this study as specifically related to citation and co-citation
of strategic issues by top managers. (The inﬂuence of heterogeneity on decision-
making will be more fully discussed in the chapter on ﬁndings). Diversity within the
top management team, and particularly the work of Simons, Pelled, Smith, 1999 ;
Nielsen and Nielsen, 2013) is also of central importance to this study which
examines the effects of time in tenure, education and gender as demographic
variables that contribute to a top management teams diversity which in turn

inﬂuences strategic decision-making and organizational performance.

Strategic Decision-Making: Within The Top Management Team

An overview of the extensive literature pertaining to decision-making within the
TMT is mapped-out by Clark and Collins (2002) in their article that tests
Eisenhardt’s theory of strategic decision making in high-Velocity environments
(Eisenhardt, 1989). The authors cite a stream ofliterature that begins in 1984
focused on demographic characteristics identiﬁed by Hambrick and Mason, and
their associated decision concepts. Top management team demographic
characteristics addressed in the literature include, age (Taylor, 1975), education
(Dolinger, 1984), job tenure heterogeneity (Wagner, Pfeffer and O'Reilly, 1984),
tenure (Goodstein and O'Reilly, 1988), past joint work experience (Zenger and
Lawrence, 1989) TMT size (Bantel and Finkelstein, 1995; Haleblian and Finkelstein,
1991; Smith et. al, 1994; Amason and Sapienza, 1997) TMT age (Hitt and Tyler,
1991), heterogeneity (Jackson, et. al., 1991; Wiersema and Bantel, 1992; Smith, et.
al, 1994; Jackson, May, and Whitney, 1995; Hambrick, Cho and Chen, 1996; Knight
et. al, 1999), education (Bantel, 1993; Wally and Baum, 1994), Hambrick, Cho and
Chen, 1996); cognitive diversity (Miller, Burke and Glick, 1998); and CEO

organizational tenure (Papadakis, Lioukas and Chambers, 1999).

Strategic Decision-Making: CEOs in Top Management Teams

17

Literature regarding the characteristics of CEOs as related to top management team
interactions and strategic decision making include, the role of external ties of top
executives (Geletkanycz and Hambrick, 1997) in which executives' boundary
spanning relations inside and outside of their organizations are examined. They
found that intra-industry ties are positively related to conformity and that extra-
industry ties are associated with 'the adoption of deviant strategies, and that the
alignment with external ties that align with the informational requirements of the
ﬁrm's strategy enhances organizational performance" (p. 654). This work is
particularly germane to this research in that library directors are devoting
increasing amounts of time and energy to connecting with stakeholders outside of
the library to advocate for resources and to build partnerships and collaborations.
This outward facing work inﬂuences strategic decision-making within the top

management team.

Hambrick (1991) proposes a model of CEO tenure that includes stages, or seasons,
in which a CEO: 1. Responds to a mandate, 2. Experiments, 3. Selects an enduring
theme, 4. Consolidates resources around the enduring theme (Convergence), and 5.
Experiences dysfunction. During this process, a CEO develops and deploys actions
drawn from his/her paradigm, which is composed of his/her repertoire (skills) and
schema (pre-existing knowledge). The authors suggest that executive discretion is a
moderating variable in this model: "the greater the CEOs discretion, the greater the
manifestations of the seasons." This theoretical construct is especially relevant to

studying the dynamics of CEOs and their leadership teams. Library directors and

18

deans tend to enjoy long tenures. Hernon (2 007) notes that "librarians are, as a
group substantially older than those in comparable professions, and they are aging
at a much faster rate" (p. 2). Wilder (in Hernon, 2007) writes "retirement levels are

already high, and will grow much higher in the near future..." (p. 2).

The political skills of CEOs, as factors affecting team performance, are examined by
KK Ahearn (2004) and Burt and Ronchi, (2 007). These studies examine how
organizational outcomes and performance are affected when CEOs seek to build
'bonding’ and 'bridging’ social capital (Putnam, 2001) The 2007 study revealed that
CEOs who actively participate in programs that promote social capital are rewarded
(through promotion and recognition) more often than CEOs who do not participate

in social outreach.

Strategic Decision-Making: The Effect of Tenure

Research into the dynamics operative within top management teams that affect
organizational performance include, work by Finkelstein and Hambrick (1990) that
uses an upper echelon framework 'to study the effect of TMT tenure and managerial
discretion.’ They found that long-tenured TMTs follow conservative paths that
conform to industry norms and this is tempered by managerial discretion. High
levels of independent discretion tend to produce strong results that inﬂuence
strategic decisions. This often-cited work argues that top management team tenure
is positively associated with, a) strategic persistence, strategic conformity and b)

performance conformity. Findings suggested that long tenures support low risk-

19

taking and the status quo and produce average results that align with industry
averages. They also found that managerial discretion by the CEO served to moderate
these variables. This study is of particular interest in the present research, in that
while CEOs may involve top managers in strategic decision-making, they likely do
this on a discretionary basis. The extent to which executive discretion moderates
top management involvement, while not a central focus of this research, is,
nevertheless a consideration that must be taken into account when looking at

decision-making within the context of the top management team.

Wiersema and Bantel (1992) examine the relationship between the demography of
top management teams and corporate change. The authors identiﬁed key
demographic characteristics in top management teams that are conducive to
change. They found that the organizations most likely to embrace change in strategy
had TMTs that were characterized by: a) lower average age, b) shorter
organizational tenure, c) higher team tenure, d) higher educational level, e) higher
educational specialization heterogeneity, and f) higher academic training in the
sciences than other teams. These ﬁndings applied to the academic library setting
provide some useful insight into the performance outcomes one might expect to see
as demographic variables (educational level, training, etc.) within the top

management team vary. These effects are explored in Chapter 5: Discussion.

Smith et. al. (1994) examines the effect of TMT demography and process on

organizational performance through the study of 53 high-tech firms. They explain

20

the demography model, in which team size, team tenure and team heterogeneity are
associated with performance; the process model, in which team size, tenure and
heterogeneity are considered with process variables, such as social integration,
informal communication and communication frequency which together inﬂuence
performance. The authors propose an intervening model, which posits "that team
demography inﬂuences organizational performance entirely through team
processes..." (p.42 0). In other words, demographic characteristics such as team size,
tenure and heterogeneity each play out through social processes (e.g., social
integration, informal communication, communication frequency) and this interplay
affects performance. This study provides insight into top management team
demography as an aspect to consider within the top management teams examined
in this study. Of particular interest are their findings on top management team size
and heterogeneity, both variables that are examined in some detail in Chapter 5:

Discussion.

Strategic Decision-Making: Diversity Within the TMT

Hambrick, Cho and Chen (1996) examine the effect of TMT heterogeneity on ﬁrms'
competitive moves by surveying 32 U.S. airlines over eight years. They found that
the teams that were diverse with respect to educational backgrounds and education
and company tenure showed a strong propensity for action. These findings agree
with those by Wiersma and Bantel mentioned above, which ﬁnd that "diversity
enhances the breadth of perspective, cognitive resources and over-all problem

solving capacity of the group" (p. 662). An equal number of researchers, however,

21

have found negative associations with TMT heterogeneity. For example, O'Reilly and
Flatt (1989) showed that company innovation was negatively related to team
heterogeneity in ﬁrm tenure in a wide cross section of ﬁrms. Wagner, Pfeffer and
O'Reilly similarly found that "heterogeneity in firm tenure was associated with
higher turnover in top management teams, and, the more distant an individual
executive was from the average of the others in the group the more likely he or she
was to depart" (p. 663). In their 1996 work, Hambrick, Cho and Chen View
competitive actions as creative moves that strategically position an organization to
compete effectively. They conclude that heterogeneity within the TMT promotes

competitive positioning.

Strategic Decision-Making: Conﬂict and Conﬁict—Management Within the TMT

Reﬂecting on the attributes that top management team members must possess,
Terrence Mech, (Director of the Library, Kings College) observes, they must "be
conﬁdent enough to raise issues and directors must be able to listen when
personnel tell you things you would rather not hear" (in Hernon, 2007, p.95). In this
observation Mech well-states the value of constructive conﬁict within the top
management team. Eisenhardt et. al. (1997) further describes the important role of
conﬂict within top management teams, which in their View leads to "the
consideration of more alternatives, a better understanding of the choices, and
overall, significantly more effective decision making" (p. 43). As an antidote to

'groupthink' that results in poor organizational performance, conﬂict provides 'a

22

more inclusive range of information, a deeper understanding of the issues, and a
richer set ofpossible solutions.’ Her research of 12 top management teams in
Silicon Valley found varying degrees of conﬂict within top management teams and
concludes that heterogeneity encourages conﬂict but that the opposite of conﬂict " is
usually not agreement, but rather apathy and disengagement" (p. 49). The authors
concluded "conﬂict is a dynamic process and that it unfolds as executives gain a
deeper grasp of their business and their preferences for action through constant

immersion in alternative Viewpoints" (p. 60).

Reﬂective of the development of perhaps a more nuanced and broader definition of
diversity, one that reﬂects both demographic characteristics and social processes,
Simons, Pelled and Smith (1999) provide insight into debate and decision
comprehensiveness within a diverse top management team setting They
hypothesize that 1. "debate moderates the impact of TMT diversity, increasing the
tendency for diversity to enhance decision comprehensiveness and performance,
and 2) that decision comprehensiveness will mediate the interactive effects of
diversity and debate on company performance. " (p. 664)

Adding to the discussion on task conﬂict with regard to top management team
decision making, Simons and Peterson (2000) find that trust is a moderating
variable between the co-appearance of cognitive conﬂict, positively associated with
organizational dynamisms, and positive group decision making outcomes, and
relationship conﬂict, or the perception of personal animosities and 'incompatibility

detrimental to decision quality and to affective commitment to the group' (p. 103).

23

Thus, "if group members trust each other, they will be more likely to accept stated
disagreements at face value and less likely to misinterpret task conﬂict behaviors by
inferring hidden agendas or personal attack as the driVing force behind the

behavior." (p. 104)

Mason Carpenter (2 002) argues that a TMT's strategic context and speciﬁcally the
complexity of a ﬁrm's strategy will likely moderate the effects of demographic
characteristics Viewed alone, including heterogeneity within the top management
team. This work is especially important to this study in light of the growing
emphasis being placed on strategic planning and strategic alignment with university
goals and objectives taking place in libraries today. Nielsen and Nielsen (2 013) also
examine the relationship between top management team diversity and firm
performance, finding that "national diversity is positively related to performance
and this effect is stronger in 1) longer tenured teams, 2) highly internationalized
firms, and 3) muniﬁcent environments"(p. 373). These ﬁndings provide a basis for
understanding some of the possible impacts of diversification within top

management teams in libraries.

Building on the notion of aligning top management characteristics and relationships
around strategic issues, Kor and Mesko (2 013) examine the TMT's dynamic
management capabilities (e.g., managerial human capital, social capital, and
cognition) and how these characteristics 'sculpt’ the management teams' absorptive

capacity', which in turn shapes the TMT's adaptive capacity" (p. 233). Dynamic

24

capabilities, the author notes, refer to the capacity of an organization to
'purposefully extend, create or modify its resource base, enabling the firm to achieve
evolutionary ﬁtness through adaptation to and/ or shaping of the external
environment" (233). The authors argue that dynamic management capabilities are
closely linked to the ﬁrm's dominant logic, or 'the way in which managers
conceptualize the business-be it in technologies, product development, distribution,
advertising, or in human resource management" (235). It is an "articulation of the
fundamental strategic beliefs, assumptions and intentions of the CEO and senior
management" (235) which "evolves to be an organizational level phenomena as a
system of expectations, beliefs, and priorities that are imbedded in the ﬁrm's
routines, procedures and resource commitments" (236). The work of Kor and
Mesko is quite useful in that academic libraries today are increasingly concerned
with alignment with the mission, goals and dominant logic of the universities in

which they reside.

Resilience, as an important top management team characteristic that affects
performance, is examined by Carmeli, Friedman and Tishler (2 013). They argue
that the capacity of a top management team to rebound from adversity
'strengthened and more resourceful' is important for business continuity reasons.
Their research further examines the extent to which connectivity between top
management team members 'facilitates a higher level of engagement in strategic
decision comprehensiveness thus enhancing top management team resilience'

(p.149). They posit that connectivity in the form of 'openness and generatiVity'

25

encourages social bonding, and trust, which results in organizational resilience, or
"the ability to interpret unfamiliar situations; to deVise new ways of confronting
these events; and to mobilize people, resources and processes to transform these
choices into reality" (p. 149). Resilience is indeed an attribute to bring into this
research on top management teams, as libraries in this study each were affected by
the economic downturn that began in 2008, and staffs and leadership in these
libraries have displayed resilience to varying degrees in response to financial

exigencies that have impacted staffing, programs, and serVices.

Organizational Theory
Select current work in the area of organizational behavior, particularly that which
examines the changing nature of organizations and human behaviors within
organizations is examined. This literature, including work that falls into the
category of organizational demography (Wagner, Pfeffer, O'Reilly, III, 1984; Zenger
and Lawrence, 1989; Lawrence, 1997; Gneezy, et. al, 2003) provides perspective on
the variables at play within organizations that impact decision-making, performance
and leadership development. The recent work of Pfeffer (2 013), in particular, will be
examined in some detail below to illustrate some of the persistent social values and

behaviors that hold true over time in organizations of all types.

Cyert and March in their seminal work, A Behavioral Theory of the Firm (1963)

describe the early development of organizational theory. The authors describe three

distinct branches of the field: The sociological branch (typified by the work of

26

Weber, Durkheim, Pareto, and Michaels), centers on bureaucracies. It "emphasized
the phenomena of division oflabor and specialization as a broad social trend and
the importance of large-scale organizations in utilizing specialized competencies"
(p. 17). Bureaucracies which, according to Perrow (1986), reached their full form
on a widespread basis only in the 20th century, are the basis for nearly all large,
complex organizations in the U.S. today, including the libraries in this study which
can be categorized as professional bureaucracies (Mintzberg, 1976). Some of the
key variables examined in sociological-based organizational research include, "sub-
goal differentiation and conﬂict, individual personality changes, and organizational

life cycle" (Cyert and March, p.17).

The social psychological branch of organizational theory, according to Cyert and
March, focused on efﬁciency, including productivity and speed studies, examined in
an experimental context. Studies in this vein have included, "communication nets,
simulated radar warning stations, and small problem-solVing groups" (p. 17). Also
included in this group are studies on 'morale and productivity', which also

emphasize a criteria of efﬁciency." (p. 17).

The administrative branch of organizational theory has traditionally dealt broadly
with decision-making processes. It diVides into two parts. The ﬁrst Views the
organization as, "a clearing house through which transfer payments are arranged
among participants (e.g., workers, investors, customers, etc.)" (p. 17). This theory

focuses on how organizations survive and the methods they use to motivate

27

organizational participants. The second part concerns theory that seeks to explain
how decisions are made within organizations, "with special emphasis upon the
process of executive inﬂuence and the impact of organizational position on
individual goals and perceptions" (p. 18). The literature most pertinent to this study
of libraries and top management teams is drawn from the administrative branch of

organizational theory.

Hierarchies

A brief reView of key literature pertaining to hierarchies, the organizational model
most closely associated with libraries, provides a useful backdrop for understanding
some basic principles associated with this type of organization, including how work
is produced, and the behaviors that are commonly found within hierarchically-

structured organizations.

Prigozhin (1980) traces the origins of hierarchies and their characteristics of
subordination, dependence, and inequality, as stemming from post—socialist
perspectives by Engels who stated [that] "the technical basis of any large producing
unit, requires all-embracing unity in the form of centralization, and this means that
questions will be resolved by authority" (p. 9). Marx, largely concurred with Lenin
on the need for central command and control in organizations, writing, "Any directly
social or joint labor...to some extent requires management to coordinate the
individual jobs...the orchestra requires a conductor" (Marx and Engels, vol. 23,

p.342; Prigozhin, 1980 p.10). Prigozhin's Views help provide one historical

28

perspective on the roots of 'command and control' management within
bureaucratic organizations and the emergence of organizational aspects typically
attributed to hierarchies, including "the centralization of power to enhance
efficiency and productivity, a unilateral personal dependence of one person on
another, and the subordination of the members of the organization to rules and

order" (p. 12).

Leavitt (2 003) writes that 'hardly anyone has a good thing to say about hierarchies,’
yet, on a fundamental level, they seem to fulfill deep psychological needs we have
for order and security (p. 1). He adds, "the intensity with which we struggle against
hierarchies only serves to highlight their durability" (p. 2). Indeed, they have not
only survived but were intricately tied to post—WW 11 management innovations,
including the human relations movement, the analytic management movement
(management by the numbers), and the communities of practice movement of the
1970s. Persistent as they may be, hierarchies are indeed deeply ﬂawed, in that they
promote authoritarianism, distrust, territoriality and fear. Leavitt argues, "Our
ability to work effectively in hierarchies depends in large measure on how we deal
with those dangers" (p. 3). Yet, they also give us 'identity' and add structure and
regularity to our daily lives and substance to our social interactions within
organizations. Leavitt concludes, "Hierarchical organizations seduce us with
psychological rewards like feelings of power and status. What's more, multi-level
hierarchies remain the best available mechanism for doing complex work. It is

unrealistic to expect that we will do away with them in the foreseeable future. It

29

seems more sensible to accept the reality that hierarchies are here to stay and work
hard to reduce their highly noxious byproducts, while making them more habitable
for humans and more productive as well" (p. 7). The work on hierarchies provides a
worthwhile frame of reference for studying decision-making within top
management teams in academic libraries. While hierarchies have been the dominant

organizational models in libraries ofthe past will this model persist in the future?

Changing Demographics in the Workplace

The inﬂux of a new generation of workers into the workplace who bring new values,
beliefs and behaviors has invited organizational scholar, Jeffrey Pfeffer (2 013) to ask
the question, "Have organizations and their employees fundamentally changed-and
if so, have they done so in a way that obviates existing organizational theory?"
Libraries, like other organizations, have not been immune to the impact of new
technologies and networks on the workplace. Social networking Via Facebook,
Twitter and related platforms, teleconferencing, Virtual meetings, coupled with the
emergence of "ﬂatter" organizations, the rise of collaborative organizational models
that involve group decision-making and shared governance, some argue, have
created the need for organizational theorists to develop new theories about how

organizations function.

Friedman (2006) for example argues that today's organizations are fundamentally

different from companies of the past in that they are "more global, more dynamic,

and innovative, and less formal and hierarchical." (Pfeffer, 2013, p. 269). This View

30

is drawn from the notion that organizations and management in organizations today
has moved beyond those formative managerial experiments that began in the post
WWII era with the human relations movement that advocated a people-focused
approach to management. This movement and its emphasis on employee
participation, teams and quality circles and which included methods such as
sensitivity training, was followed by an era of analytical management or
'management by the numbers.’ A third trend, management by small groups, or
communities of practice which emerged in the 1980s is best exemplified by
companies like Apple that employed growing numbers of younger employees who
were, "fast, daring, ingenious, and totally task oriented." (Leavitt 2003, p.4) While
these managerial fashions were often superimposed on hierarchical structures, their

effect on today's organizations remains.

One artifact of these trends is the emergence of the so-called 'ﬁat' organization in
which work is carried out by teams who exhibit a high degree of collaboration to
achieve shared goals and objectives. Pfeffer (2 013) notes that with the changes in
interpersonal dynamics resulting from today's ﬁat, team-based work environments
—--enVironments often inhabited by increasing numbers of Millennials--one would
expect to see the emergence of new management theories, particularly pertaining to
power and inﬂuence, aspects usually positively associated with hierarchies. Such
changes in organizations (e.g., ﬁat, global, egalitarian, etc.) coupled with a de-
emphasis on the theories of power and inﬂuence, associated with organizational

models of the past, could well impact the ways in which we think about top

31

management team behaviors today and particularly ways in which we think about
orienting top management team members to assume positions of leadership in 21St

century libraries and archives.

Yet, in spite of notions of the workplace becoming, kinder, ﬂatter, and more
egalitarian, certain human behaviors persist. The marginalization of women in the
workplace (Carter and Silva, 2010), competitiveness (Gneezy, Niederle, and
Rustichini, 2003) and the use of coercion (Offerman and Schrier, 1985) continue to
be documented. Pfeffer (2 007) characterizes these attributes as 'fundamental and
unchanging social and organizational dynamics of the workplace. He articulates six
processes that in addition to being 'both fundamental and apparently unchanging’
"profoundly affect people's motivations and interactions in work environments."
(Pfeffer p. 271) These six attributes provide insight into human behavior within
organizations and can possibly be useful in addressing the problem of the Black Box
Theory (Lawrence, 1997) that seeks to describe demographic variables (e.g.,
psychological and social processes) not adequately defined or observable in
congruence theory (Pfeffer, 1983) a central tenant within organizational
demography. 2 Pfeffer's attributes offer a useful backdrop for understanding some of
the key characteristics that motivate individuals within organizations, including

today's academic and research libraries. The attributes include:

 

2 Within organizational demography, a theory that involves replacing subjective concepts (attitudes, etc.) with
demographic ones (age, tenure, etc.) the justification of which is, "the assumption ofcongruence between
demographic predictors and subjective concepts." (Lawrence, 1997 p.3)

32

Hierarchy — With the proliferation of personal computers, smart phones, tablets and
other technologies that support mass personal communication, "social networking,
and crowd sourcing has increased the tendency to see hierarchy as disappearing
and being irrelevant..." (Pfeffer, 2013, p.2 72). Yet, Pfeffer argues that in spite of the
emergence of "inexpensive computing that makes horizontal collaboration possible"
hierarchies persist. He argues that they are 'fundamental structural principles of all
organizational systems' be they social, technical or biological. Hierarchies make
complexity possible, be it within social settings or within bio organisms. While
Leavitt notes [that], "hardly anyone has a good thing to say about hierarchies"
(Leavitt, 2003 p, 1) humans ironically ﬁnd hierarchies both practical — in that they
help foster productivity — and psychologically useful in that they "fulﬁll deep seated
needs for order and security" (Pfeffer, p. 272) a ﬁnding confirmed in empirical
studies by Tiedens, Unzueta and Young (2 007). Pfeffer notes that hierarchies create
important consequences for behavior. He notes that, " if there are hierarchies of
power and status, most individuals will prefer to be near the top" in part because

financial rewards are higher near the top.

Perceptions of Competence — If hierarchies persist in organizations and individuals
within those organizations are essentially competing for recognition and
advancement, what then are some of the characteristics that will lead to success?
While the behavioral characteristics of 'warmth' and competence are often
positively associated with desirable attributes in the workplace, it turns out that just

the opposite is true: warm people are considered to be less competent. (Cuddy,

33

2009) Powerful people, Pfeffer argues (2013 p. 273) "have the discretion to be
angry because their power provides them with more latitude in their behavior. The
co-occurrence of anger and power then leads to the heuristic association of power
with anger-if powerful people get to be angry, people who display anger are
assumed to be powerful." Individuals within organizations are 'highly attuned' to
tracking who will prevail, who has the 'mental toughness' to succeed. "Breaking
rules, displaying anger, not being warm and nice is not necessarily behavior that we

intuitively think of when we consider leadership." (Pfeffer, 2 013 p. 273).

The Self—Enhancement Motive — Closely connected to one's survival within an
organization is "the motivation to think favorably and positively about one's self."
(Pfeffer, 2013, p. 274). This tendency to believe that one is 'above average' on
attributes such as income and social status can within an organization lead to "a
belief in the efﬁcacy of one's actions" on organizational performance. A result of this
self—illusion within an organizational context is that it breeds confidence, which in
turn can be contagious. The display of self—conﬁdence can have negative
consequences. For example, in studies that looked at gender equality in the
workplace, Reuben, Rey-Biel, Sapienza and Zingales (2012) found that men's over
conﬁdence "resulted in their being disproportionately selected [over women] for
leadership roles." (Pfeffer, 2013 p.274). Additionally, one's beliefin one's 'self—
efﬁcacy' produces, 'an orientation toward action' that is positively associated with
power. It seems that "illusions of control and the consequences of believing that

everything that one touches is better" (Pfeffer et. al, 1998; Pfeffer, 2012 p. 2 74)

34

affects all generational cohorts, and is no less prevalent, Pfeffer notes, among
younger generations: "if anything, their upbringing and the evidence on narcissism

would suggest even stronger self—enhancement motives." (Pfeffer, 2012 p, 2 74).

Us Versus Them and the Importance of Similarity-There is a strong tendency for
individuals who think highly of themselves (see #3 above) to align with those in an
organization who exhibit tendencies similar to their own. Similarity, it is argued, is
perhaps the most important basis of interpersonal attraction (Byrne, 1971; Montoya
and Horton, 2013). This 'ego-centric bias' manifests itself in various ways, such as
through mimicry, 'a give and take of words and gestures' which can result in
"immediate social bonding between strangers." (Pfeffer, 275). A bias in favor of
those who look, act or otherwise resemble themselves, "makes elimination of
discrimination in organizational career processes both difficult and unlikely."
(Pfeffer, p 275). It also results in 'homo-social reproduction' that is the hiring,
promotion and favorable reView of those who exhibit similar characteristics in the
workplace. By extension, those who display behaviors and Views similar to those in

power will likely enjoy career advancement success.

Basking in Reﬂected Glory and the Desire to Be With the Winners — The desire to
think well of one's self and to associate with successful organizations, groups, or
individuals, is in Pfeffer's View linked to a primordial desire 'to have one's genetic
materials survive.’ (Pfeffer, 2013 p. 275). This innate human characteristic requires

first that one first be able to, "discern and then associate oneself with the individuals

35

most likely to win in a ﬁght for survival." (p.2 75). Theorists posit that the drive to be
close to success often outweighs everything, including working for a difﬁcult and
unpleasant boss, as long as that boss is Viewed as successful. The closer one is
drawn to powerful and successful individuals, the greater one is able to 'bask in
their glory' through association, even if that association is weak. Pfeffer notes that,
"once deciding to be close, many individuals will come to rationalize that decision by
noting the many ways in which the powerful individual (or organization) is actually
better than the public perception and in reality offers an attractive working

environment and many social benefits." (p. 2 76)

Hedonic Sense Making and Post Hoc Rationalizations — In his theory on cognitive
dissonance, Festinger (1957) argued that people are motivated to 'eliminate or
reduce discrepant cognitions.’ Within organizations, a strong power and inﬂuence
behavior is that which aims to, "reduce dissonance and therefore rationalize
behavior." (Pfeffer, p. 276). For example, in efforts to produce cognitive consistency,
individuals will attribute numerous positive traits to success even if these traits had
little to actually do with the success. In the realm of power and leadership, powerful
individuals are presumed (because of their success) to possess many positive traits.
(Pfeffer, p. 276) To avoid cognitive dissonance, individuals reevaluate the powerful
in ways that create (or infer) positive traits even if such traits are not real. Pfeffer
notes, "To avoid cognitive dissonance, individuals will also, make excuses for the
powerful if dissonance-reducing attributions of positive qualities and behaviors are

too difficult to construct." (p.276) A manifestation of this is the masking or

36

attenuation of disturbing facts about a powerful leader in order to preserve
cognitive consistency. This 'excuse-making’ helps explain, why the powerful behave

differently and in turn how their behavior affects those around them. (p.276)

Many of these characteristics (e.g., the desire for order, reward, recognition, etc.) are
commonly associated with organizational hierarchies. While the common ﬂaws of
hierarchies, such as the promotion of authoritarianism, distrust, dishonesty,
territoriality, and fear, are well known, in Leavitt's View (2 003, 2005) hierarchies
have demonstrated 'impressive adaptability' over time by providing structural
stability to organizations of all types. The structural stability they provide, "delivers
real practical and psychological value" (2003, p.2) by not only 'enslaVing' workers

but by fulfilling "our deep needs for order and security." (p.2)

Additionally, it is often stated that today's generation of young workers have career
patterns that are fundamentally different from those of previous generations. In a
study of Matures, Baby Boomers, Generation Xers and Millennials, Lyons, et. al.

(2 012) found there to be, "limited evidence to support the idea that careers are
becoming less traditional with each successive generation. " (p. 351) The authors
further note that, "despite a great deal more job mobility and organizational
mobility in the younger generations, it appears that the upward linear path is still

prevalent." (p. 351).

37

The upshot of these findings — the persistence of survival behaviors within
organizations, the quest for personal recognition and individuals' drive for upward
mobility, coupled with the continued presence of hierarchies— suggest that
paradigm shifts in terms of organizational theory or human behaviors have not yet
occurred in today's organizations, including libraries. The continued inﬂuence of
demographic attributes, and the ways in which these variables affect top managers
and in turn organizational performance, on the other hand, argues for more probing
research into top management team dynamics and into the related issue of how top
management teams members are developing the skills and knowledge through
involvement in strategic decision-making to assume leadership positions in today's

academic and research libraries.

Library Leadership
Important research has been carried out since the late 1960s (Morrison, 1969; Mech
and McCabe, 1998) to better understand some of the traits that the next generation
of library leaders must possess. For example, in an effort to understand the 'nature
and content of current and emerging jobs in academic libraries' Lynch & Smith
(2 001) in a content analysis of academic library job ads in College and Research
Libraries noted that computer technologies, instructional skills, and oral and written

communication skills were explicitly sought.

Hernon, Powell, and Young (2 001) examine some of the core attributes of future

academic library leaders and the types of institutions from which they might be

38

drawn. Through multiple data collection methods, the authors identify some of the
core attributes that the current set (n=12 6) of Association of Research Libraries
believe the next generation oflibrary CEOs should possess. These managerial,
leadership attributes included the ability to plan and carry out projects. Personnel
skill attributes included the ability to interact and communicate well with others.
General areas of knowledge were also identified, such as an understanding of
scholarly communication, knowledge of financial management, and trends in higher

education. (Hernon, Powell and Young, 37-39).

In a second study, Hernon, Powell & Young (2 002) draw together Views of ARL
directors and their assistant directors to identify attributes that library leaders will
need to possess in the next 10 years. Composite results of this study concluded that
future leaders will need to possess Vision, sound planning and management skills,
and emotional intelligence with regard to interacting with others within and outside
of the organization. Explicitly not mentioned in the study are leadership skills
related to use of strategic thinking associated with the introduction, integration, and
use of new technologies or communication networks to support scholarly work or
advance learning. Subsequently, Hernon (2 007) conducted a follow up study that
surveyed a cohort of Generation X librarians on the attributes identiﬁed in the 2002
study mentioned above. He found that, "despite some real differences, it should be
emphasized that nearly two thirds of the leadership attributes as articulated by
Generation X librarians may be found on the lists generated by ARL and non-ARL

library directors." (2 007 p.165).

39

Hernon (2 007) points to two importantjournal volumes issued in 2001 and 2002
devoted to library leadership. The ﬁrst was a 2001 volume ofthe journal ofLibrary
Administration, which covered topics such as recruitment, information technology in
the Virtual library, ﬁnancial management, diversity, women in leadership, evaluating
leaders, and global leadership. The second journal issue devoted to library
leadership was the spring issue of Library Trends, which covered topics as
"leadership renewal, career paths to advancement, mentoring and job rotation" (p.
62). A follow-up volume of Library Trends devoted to library leadership appeared in
2004 that contained articles on organizational development, culture change within
libraries, and training programs for leaders. Florence Mason and Louella
Weatherbee, writing in this volume and in response to the changing demographics
taking place in libraries, particular the 'graying' of the profession, concluded,
"libraries will undoubtedly experience a loss of a large number library leaders, and
libraries and library organizations must continue to expand leadership training if

there is to be a new cohort ofleaders ready to take over." (Hernon, 2007)

But it is not just the promotion of skills and attributes that align with the current
business practices found in libraries today that are necessary to assure the
development of leaders. According to Maloney, Antelman, Arlitsch, and Butler

(2 010) in a survey of177 emerging library leaders (70% of which were between the
ages of 30-40) there is a perception among this group of a 'significant gap between

their current and preferred organizational cultures, and that their current

40

organizational cultures limit their effectiveness." (p. 2) The study finds that "the
preferred culture, as perceived by this population, is more ﬂexible and externally
oriented than the current culture, that leaders feel 'limited' in their effectiveness and
impact by their libraries' current organizational cultures, and the more internally
focused and less ﬂexible their libraries are the more 'thwarted' they feel. Finally, the
study found that future leaders who are most frustrated are the most likely to leave

the ﬁeld." (p.32)

Sharon Gray Weiner, in her literature reView of the academic library leadership
between 1998-2003, covers topics such as recruitment, roles and responsibilities of
library directors, and characteristics and management style. She concluded, that
"many aspects of leadership have not been addressed and that a comprehensive
body of evidence —based research is needed." (Weiner, p. 14). Hernon (2 007)
echoes this sentiment, observing, " The leadership literature, except within LIS, has
grown at a phenomenal rate since 2002 ...LIS needs to examine the same types of

issues pursued in other leadership literatures." (p. 66)

Both Hernon and Rossiter (2 007) and Kreitz (2 009) have studied emotional
intelligence traits of both library directors and their top management teams. Kreitz's
work seeks to identify the traits shared by library directors and top management
teams. Kreitz (2 009) concludes, that "although some of the traits identiﬁed as most
important build on an individual's innate personal qualities, many researchers and

practitioners agree that emotional intelligence traits can be acquired and

41

strengthened through formal coursework, workshops, and leadership institutes,
mentoring, on-the-job coaching, analytical tools, and, ﬁnally, rigorous self—scrutiny
and practice." (p. 547) One aspect of this research is to determine the extent to

which TMT members are developing these attributes on the job.

Seeking to better understand the Views of external actors who often have a direct
inﬂuence on library operations, including resource allocations, Lynch, et. al. (2 007)
interviewed the presidents and provosts of select universities and compared
findings with an earlier study (Grimes, 1992-93). The research found that Views of
the library had changed significantly in the intervening years since the Grimes study
was conducted. For example, the concept of the library as 'the heart of the
university' was not as strongly embraced as it was in the earlier study, this due in
some part to the ubiquity of electronic information technology and online sources.
Additionally, respondents stated the increasing value they are placing on evidence
that the library is contributing in a qualitative, measurable way to learning and
research. Lynch notes, "Library operational costs, usage, and services are now being
considered with an eye to measuring effectiveness. This ﬁnding may reﬂect both the
current academic culture of assessment, economic challenges, and increases in

demands on the library budget." (2 007, p. 224).

One of the questions closely connected to the dynamics operative within the top
management teams focused on strategy and performance is to what extent in their

day-to-day work are top management team members gaining the skills and

42

knowledge needed to assume leadership positions. Since 2000, between 10 and 20
library CEO vacancies have occurred each year, with college library directorships
and directorships within masters' degree granting institutions occurring with
increased frequency. Rossiter notes that the 'graying' of the profession will result in
25% oftoday's librarians being 65 years of age by 2009 and 58% will be 65 by 2019.
Wilder (2 000) reports that 91% ofARL directors were 50 years or older in 1998. As
a result of these compelling statistics, directors have begun to discuss succession
planning within their own organizations to address the looming leadership
shortage. Directors have begun to reach out to library leadership programs to
express this concern and encourage dialog around the skills and knowledge that
upcoming leaders might need to possess as they move into leadership positions.
Hernon and others have designed advanced degree programs aimed specifically at
directors of academic and public libraries. Galbraith, Smith & Walker (2 011)
identify some specific ways in which ARL libraries are on a programmatic level
addressing succession planning. Their findings show that there is, "a gap between
the perceived importance of various principles of succession planning and how well
the principles are practiced." (p. 221) The authors stress the need for libraries to
include succession planning in their strategic planning, as an important step toward

addressing the looming leadership shortage in academic libraries.

Surprisingly little research has focused on the dynamics operative within the top

management teams in library organizations and the effects of these interactions on

organizational performance and leadership development. In a series of interviews

43

with library directors, Hernon (2 007) and colleagues asked the question, "Is there a
perception among library staff that the director is the sole leader of the library?" Is
such a perception correct or incorrect? The responses were mixed but the
conclusion was that the perception was generally incorrect, that top management
team members participated to some extent in the leadership of the library. Lynch,
commenting on the study notes, "these are perceptions, of course; what is needed

are actual data." It is a goal of this research to provide insight into this question.

Questions regarding strategy as related to organizational performance within the
top management team are important for succession planning in academic libraries,
because knowledge, skills and experience acquired on the job--much of which is
through involvement with strategic decision-making—-provide essential training
needed for leaders to move into directorships. Thus, a chief focus of this research
will be on how the dynamics within this coalition in an academic research library
setting, inﬂuence strategic decisions, organizational performance and leadership
development and support the thesis of this research project, which is that library
directors (CEOs) do involve their top management teams in strategic decisions to
enhance organizational performance, and this involvement serves as 'on-the-job'
training to prepare top management team members to assume positions as library

directors.

Building upon the research mentioned above (Hernon, Powell, Young) aimed at

identifying some of the key characteristics and attributes that the next generation of

44

library directors must possess, this research examines the literature and methods
found in Upper Echelon Theory, formulated most notably by Hambrick and Mason
(1984) and Finkelstein (1990,2009). In this regard the aim is to assess the impact
that the top management team has on library outcomes. While the library
profession has worried about the "graying” of the leadership and succession
planning, it has not given adequate systematic attention or thought to the speciﬁc
characteristics of members of the top management team, speciﬁcally the
distribution of top management team attributes as related to organizational

outcomes. Thus, some of these attributes will be considered.

The aforementioned work of Pfeffer (2 013) offers one perspective into the ways in
which the values and careers of younger generations may impact the behavior of top
management teams and organizations. Additional factors that might affect
organizational behavior, the relationship between the library executive and the top
management team are found in Lyons' empirical assessment of generational
differences in basic human values (2 005) and his examination of trends in career
mobility among generational cohorts (2 012) 3. It may be that the field oflibrary
management and administration has not fully recognized the significance that these
factors play in inﬂuencing top management team behavior, in relation to
organizational outcomes and leadership development. Thus, the secondary purpose

of this research is to provide insight into these issues.

 

3 In the 2012 study Lyons, et. al. find that, "younger generations change jobs and employers at a greater rate
than previous generations and that they are more willing to accept non-upward career moves." (p. 333)

45

To better understand the role top management teams play in shaping organizational
performance through strategic decision-making, this research focuses on the
characteristics of individual managers within the top management team. This line
ofinquiry is drawn from the supposition by Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven (199 0)
and Carpenter (2 002) and most recently Nielsen (2 013) and Raes (2 013) who
together claim that the demographic qualities of executives (either individuals or
teams) are highly related to strategy and performance outcomes. Thus, team
characteristics and team inﬂuence on strategy and performance outcomes offer a
useful lens through which to examine management and leadership development
within academic libraries. Each line of inquiry will help identify the salient
attributes likely to be found in the next generation of library leaders. Finally, as
Hernon (2 007) observes, as there is no single work in the literature on library
leadership, there is a need to examine leaders themselves, their effectiveness,
nurturing, and renewal, and their interactions with followers and leaders." (p. xiv)
This research aims to substantively address this need by providing new insight into
the dynamics of leadership operative within top management teams in academic
and research libraries that shape organizational outcomes while developing the next

generation oflibrary leaders.

While the library leadership literature alone is tremendously helpful in
understanding, from various internal and external perspectives, some of the key
qualities the next generation of library leaders should possess, its value is enhanced

considerably when complemented by the literature on strategic decision-making

46

and organizational theory. The multiple perspectives offered by these streams of
literature provide for a richer context in which to examine decision-making in top
management settings. Together the convergence of the scholarly work from these
three traditions will render a more nuanced understanding the social,
organizational and behavioral settings in which emergent leaders are developing
the skills and acquiring the knowledge to assume executive leadership roles in
libraries. It is hoped that findings from this study will open up new questions
regarding the dynamic interactions that take place within top management teams,

which contribute to the development of library leaders.

CHAPTER 3: DESIGN OF THE STUDY/METHODOLOGY

Introduction

The question 'to what extent are chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) in academic and
research libraries involving their top management team (TMT) members in
strategic issues that affect organizational performance, and, the extent to which this
involvement, when present, is preparing top managers to assume leadership
positions as CEOs?’ is not one that has been specifically addressed in the library
literature. As such there is no body of data to consult, or published work that
specifically addresses this question. Thus an ethnographic method was selected to
gather as much rich data as possible on this topic. Rosenthal and Rosnow (1984)

note that, "One's choice of a given method of data collection or measurement will...

47

depend on the context in which it is to be used." (p. 157) As this research probes
areas not addressed in the mainstream library literature, it can best be Viewed as
exploratory. As such, there was a keen interest in gathering as much rich data from
those who could offer perspective on the research questions as possible. A second
reason for choosing this method is that the population from which data were to be
gathered, " have the language and experience to describe their own actions and
reactions" to the issues central to this research (ibid. p. 179). The rationale for using
semi- structured interviews (which involve a combination of closed-, and open-
ended questions) is that this approach "provides an opportunity to establish a
rapport with the subjects and to stimulate trust and cooperation" (ibid. p. 179). The
establishment of trust and cooperation with participants was essential to the
successful collection of data through interviews and helped produce a positive
response to the follow-up questionnaire that was sent to participants after they
were interviewed. A variable that likely inﬂuenced subjects' responses — hopefully
in a favorable way — was that the interviewer was a member of the professional
group being interviewed and this was made known to subjects prior to the
interviews taking place. This fact may have served as an 'icebreaker' with
participants and contributed in some small measure to the establishment of trust

and cooperation.

The ethnographic method used for this research is drawn from social anthropology.

Clifford Gertz (1973) describes open-ended interviews as capable of creating a

'thick description' of phenomena. On the other end of the spectrum are interviews

48

that are tightly structured around speciﬁc questions, and which may be Viewed as
more survey-like in the results they produce. This study attempts to find a middle
ground between the two extremes. It achieves this through a semi-structured
approach in which speciﬁc questions (and follow up questions) are asked of
participants and responses noted. In this study some open ended questions were
asked, such as, 'What strategic issues do you see on the horizon that will affect your
library?" Closed-ended questions were also asked. For example, participants were
asked to rank their level of satisfaction with the outcome of a strategic decision on a
scale of 1-5 with 1 being 'not satisfied' and 5 being 'Very satisfied.’ The combination
of open-, and closed- ended questions produced rich results of both a qualitative and
quantitative nature. These results are presented below in Chapter 4: Findings.
Interviews were carried-out in private with 34 participants who kindly agreed to be
interviewed. The participants, who were selected from 6 research libraries, were
composed of library directors and their top management teams. The
operationalization of the research thesis, suggested a strong emphasis be placed on
strategic-decision making and how this takes place within the top management
team. Thus, considerable data ﬂows from this question. Demographic data
pertaining to individual top management team members is also carefully considered
to assess the role age, time in tenure, and promotion history plays in decision-
making.

Project Design

49

Two sets of questions guide this research. The first set relates to the composition

and demographics of the top management team (TMT).

Examples of questions related to composition and demographics, include, for

example:

-Who comprises the TMT?

-What are the job titles of TMT members?

-How frequently does the TMT meet and who participates?

-What are some of the key demographic characteristics of the TMT members (e.g.,
time in tenure, time in the library, time in the profession, gender, terminal degree,

gender, mentorship experiences, and promotion history)?

The second set of questions relates to decision-making within the context of the top
management team. Examples of questions related to decision-making, include, for

example:

-What are two strategic decisions the library has addressed in the past three years?
-What roles did TMT members play in these strategic decisions?

-Does the TMT function as a group in making strategic decisions? Does this vary
depending upon the decision?

-What is the role of the CEO in inﬂuencing TMT decisions?

50

-What role does the person to whom the CEO reports play in determining strategic

direction?

These questions and variations thereof were asked of subjects (n=34) in a
controlled interview setting by the principal investigator (P.I.). The responses were

audio recorded with permission.

Data analysis of interviews involved coding, compiling and tabulating responses to

1) Questions related to composition and demographics ofthe TMT (e.g., Who
comprises the TMT?, What are the job titles of the TMT Members?, How

Frequently does the TMT meet?, etc.).

2) Questions related to strategic decision-making within the TMT (e.g., Two
strategic decisions the library has made in the past three years, speciﬁc roles

of TMT members in those decisions, perception of decision outcome, etc.).

Representation of demographic data and strategic decision-making data together
revealed key ﬁndings (e.g., the presence of co-citation of a strategic issue by a TMT
member and the CEO in relation to whether the TMT member had been hired or
promoted by that CEO, etc.) that are discussed below in the Chapters 4 (Findings)
and 5 (Discussion).

Methodology

51

A socio-ethnographic research method,4 the semi-structured interview was used as
the primary means of data collection for this project. The processes associated with
this approach involved, data collection and documentation of responses,
organization of the data, connecting various groups of data to understanding how
these related to the research question(s), and representing data in various ways to
present ﬁndings. To collect data, the Principal Investigator (P.I.) conducted semi-
structured interviews (of approximately one hour in length) with 34 participants in
six (6) academic /research university library settings. Three of the participating
institutions are public and three are private. Written consent to participate was
granted by all 34 participants. The interviews were audio recorded with permission
and followed-up with a brief mailed questionnaire sent to participants. UCLA
Institutional Review Board approval for the research was successfully obtained
prior to starting the project. Interview schedules, recitals, consent forms, and the
follow up questionnaire are found in Appendix 1. A follow up questionnaire was

sent to all participants that invited participants to expand on interview questions.

Description of Data Set

Preparation

 

4 Ethnography, ‘is the art and science used to describe a group or culture,’ (Fetterman, 1998;
Sangasubana, 2011, p. 568). "Ethnographers search for predictable patterns in the lived human
experiences by carefully observing and participating in the lives of those under study." (ibid, p. 568)
An ethnographic (inductive) approach was selected for this study to gain a nuanced understanding of
the interactions between subjects, their motivations and behaviors, aspects of the study group that
could only be understood through direct interaction with study participants.

52

The individuals and institutions participating in this research were carefully
selected to provide variability. To achieve this, three public and three private U.S.
libraries in academic institutions were selected to participate. Geographic
distribution was also sought. While the three institutions are located in one state,
the other three institutions are distributed across the U.S. Each of the institutions is
located in a busy metropolitan area. Four of the six libraries in this study are
members of the Association of Research Libraries group. Below is additional

information about the participating institutions:

6.Private RU/VH 20,000 $37M 271

(* Masters Colleges and Universities I ; ** Research University/Very high research
activity; Data are current as of 2012)

Public vs. Private

The chief reason why the study looks at both public and private institutions is to
examine whether there are substantive differences in ﬁndings between these types
of libraries in terms of the way in which the TMT teams are organized, their roles,

factors that generate issues of strategic importance, and findings.

Subjects/Participants/Protocols

53

Chief Executive Officers (e.g., University Librarians, Deans of Libraries) and top
management teams were selected as subjects for this study based on the
assumption, drawn from the literature and from conversations with library deans
and directors, that it is this group that addresses strategic decision-making in
library organizations. To identify specific individuals in top management teams in
the libraries studied, the principal investigator asked CEOs in the institutions
studied to identify members of his /her top management team. All participants were
briefed by the R]. on the study and recitals for the project were shared that outlined
the purpose and scope of the research prior to data gathering. All participants
(n=34) reViewed and signed a Consent Form (See Appendix 1) prior to being
interviewed. Interviews with participants took place between October 2014 and

March 2015.

Data Collection

Data were collected for each institution that participated in the study and each
individual participant. Institutional data for participating institutions was gathered
primarily from published material and institutional websites that contained
descriptions about the libraries, including their projects, priorities, and initiatives.
Information was gathered about participants from library websites and the open
web, including biographical sketches of participants, publications, and participation
in professional activities. In-person data collection took place in private settings
within participating libraries. Participating libraries were very accommodating in

providing the principal investigator a private room to carry out interviews with

54

participants. Each participant was briefed on the scope of the project and provided
the R]. with written and verbal consent to participate. Interviews were audio

recorded.

Data organization and analysis

Data organization and analysis took place on several levels. Demographic data about
top team members, such as time in tenure, time in the profession, gender, etc. were
tabulated manually. Certain tabulated tables of demographic data were combined,
such as time in tenure before promotion, to see ifthere were relationships between
findings. These are presented below in Chapter 4: Findings. The strategic issues that
participants identified were coded according to common themes and the results are
presented accordingly. Un-coded responses are also examined particularly as
related to individual participants' roles in strategic decisions. These responses are
presented in abbreviated form with emphasis on key contributions participants
reported they had made. Audio recordings were listened to repeatedly with a
progressive focus on aspects of subjects' narratives that provided useful insight into
interview questions. Individual interviews ranged from approximately 45 to 180
minutes in length per participant. Findings from interviews are represented in
Chapter 4: Findings. Additionally, a follow-up questionnaire was sent to participants
that invited participants to expand upon material covered in the interview. A 68%
response rate to the follow-up survey was obtained. Findings from the follow-up
questionnaire corroborated responses to interview questions. A potential limit to

the method and approach used in this study is that it is synchronic, that is, it gathers

55

data from individuals and from organizations on just one day in the life of an
organization. Participants' individual narratives and responses to the questions
central to this study might also be looked at diachronically, or over time. Diachronic
or longitudinal study would provide further validation of the findings from this
study. Indeed, certain aspects of this study may well lend themselves to future

investigations. Some options in this regard are discussed in Chapter 6: Conclusion.

CHAPTER 4: FINDINGS

Introduction
This section contains responses to two sets of key questions asked of participants
that together are designed to provide insight into the extent to which CEOs are
involving their top management teams in strategic decision-making as a way of
preparing them to assume executive leadership positions in academic libraries. The
first set of questions below (Part 1: Organizational Structure and the Top
Management Team) focuses on formal library organization (as detailed on the
organization charts that were shared with the principal investigator prior to the
study). Data are presented regarding those individuals who on the library's
organization charts are considered to be on the top management team (TMT), the
size and composition of the TMT; the composition of the TMT by title; the frequency
of meetings of the TMT, and demographic characteristics of the TMT. These data

address the following research questions:

-Who comprises the TMT?

56

-What are the job titles of TMT members?

-How frequently does the TMT meet and who participates?

-What are some of the key demographic characteristics of the TMT members (e.g.,
time in tenure, time in the library, time in the profession, gender, terminal degree,

and promotion history)?

Responses to a second set of questions (Part 2: Strategic Decisions) focuses
specifically on strategic decision-making within the TMT. In this section,
participant's responses to the two most important (strategic) decisions made by the
library during the past three years are presented, including responses to a series of
sub-questions about those decisions, such as how the issue came to their attention,
who was involved in the decision, if documents were provided, generated, created,
or shared, the roles of participants, level of satisfaction with the outcome and the
degree of agreement within the TMT on the ﬁnal decision. These responses address

the following research questions:

-What are two strategic decisions the library has addressed in the past three years?
-What roles did TMT members play in these strategic decisions?

-Does the TMT function as a group in making strategic decisions? Does this vary
depending upon the decision?

-What is the role of the CEO in inﬂuencing TMT decisions?

-What role does the person to whom the CEO reports play in determining strategic

direction?

57

The strategic issues identiﬁed by participants are presented in two ways. In Table 5:
Distribution of Strategic Issues by Type, coded responses are presented within
categories (i.e., serVices/programs, collections, space, organizational, financial, and
management). Instances of co-citation of strategic issues (Table 9, Table 10) and
instances of TMT Member and CEO Co-citation (Table 11) are provided. The
strategic issues most frequently cited use coded responses. Responses to the
questions of how strategic issues came to top managers' attention, who participated
in the decision-making process, whether documents were provided, created,
generated, or shared in the decision-making process, and measures of satisfaction
and inﬂuence related to strategic decisions are based on un-coded responses. Full
responses to several ofthese questions are found in a series of appendices at the

end of the study.

These data are followed by responses to questions that provide contextual data
about the organizations studied and top managers within these organizations. A
series of responses on how, from participants' perspectives, success is measured
were asked to gain perspective on the relationships between strategic decision-
making and performance. A question on whether participants benefitted from being
mentored during their careers was asked to probe if the presence ofa mentoring

culture within the cohort studied was present.

Part 1: Organizational Structure and the Top Management Team

58

Organizational Structure and TMT Composition

Organization charts from each of the participating libraries were shared with the RI.
prior to interviews with participants. These were then shared with participants in
the interview sessions. Individual participants were asked to examine the
organization chart for their institution and answer a series of questions. These
questions pertained to organizational structure and the composition of the top

management team. Responses to these questions are found below.

Defining the Top Management Team (TMT)
Each Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO) (Library Director, Dean of Libraries, etc.) was
asked in advance of the interviews to identify for the RI. those individuals
considered to be on his/her TMT. Some CEOs have TMT members (with titles such
as Associate University Librarian or Director) who manage 'functional' areas, and a
series of direct reports (often including non-librarians who are often from non-
management areas) who adVise on strategic matters, and help the CEO manage the
political, ﬁnancial, human resource and public relations aspects of strategic
decisions. All individuals who the CEO identified as TMT members were
interviewed. Within the study group of libraries, the TMT is variously referred to as:

Executive Group

Dean's Council

Administrative Group

Administrative Team

59

Administrative Committee

Directors Group
Each TMT member was asked to identify on a current organization chart the
individuals who they considered to be members of the TMT. Subjects most often
identified TMT members as those who managed the library's functional areas.
Organizational diagrams from each of the libraries studied are found in Appendix 2.
The organizational designs represented by the charts are typical of hierarchical

organizations.

(n=34)

Range 1 3

 

The public institutions studied tended to have more compact top management teams
than private institutions. One reason for this may be the way in which CEOs in
public institutions deﬁne their top managers. Generally, top managers in public
institutions were identified as Associate University Librarians, each of whom
managed portfolios related to operational areas in the library (e.g., technical
services, public services, etc.). CEOs in these institutions (and TMT members) noted

--depending on the strategic issue being addressed -- that line managers and other

60

 

individuals would be consulted, but that these individuals did not normally make up
the core group charged with strategic decision making.

By contrast, CEOs in private institutions tended to identify a rather more expansive
group of individuals as those routinely involved in strategic decision-making. Like
public institutions, individuals in this group included those with portfolios that
aligned to the operational aspects of the organization, but also included individuals,
who served other functions (e.g., chief of staff, development ofﬁcer, public relations
person, legal adVisor, etc.). Top team members' formal titles varied. Below is a table
that shows the distribution of individual TMT members by title.

Structured Interview Questions

61

Interviews began with participants being asked, "Does this organization chart
reﬂect the current design of the library?" Respondents pondered this question on
average for about 1 minute before answering. 76.5% ofparticipants responded 'yes'
to this question. The remaining 23.5% of respondents made corrections to the chart,
reﬂective of recent changes within organizations. One CEO commented that the
chart was indeed correct, 'but not for long' as the library was about to undergo a

complete reorganization.

This question was directly followed by a question that invited participants to,
"Please identify those who you believe to be on the TMT." As mentioned above, CEOs
tended to identify their TMT members as AULs or other direct reports who manage
specific portfolios within the organization. CEOs were also quick to point out others
listed on the chart that they call upon for adVice depending on the strategic issue.
One CEO mentioned that these individuals meet with the TMT monthly to share

information with the TMT and characterized these folks as 'key advisors.’

TMT members tended to also identify those individuals reporting directly to the
CEO with portfolio management responsibilities as comprising the TMT. They
frequently pointed to groups of line managers and supervisors (the next tier down
in the organization) as also informing strategic decision making if only on an

occasional basis.

62

Participants were asked the related question, "Are there others not on the chart that
you would consider to be members of the TMT (including external bodies, such as
Boards, University Administration, Councils, Deans, etc.)" Responses to this question
varied. Most CEOs stated that on a day-to-day basis those on the organization chart
were involved most directly with strategy work. The CEOs were also quick to point
to boards, committees of students and faculty advisors, funders, academic
committees within the university as entities that--though not directly involved in
developing strategic approaches to problems and issues--nevertheless played an
inﬂuential role in supporting the library. In two cases CEOs noted that there weren't
too many strategic issues involving resources or changes in core business practices
that could be made in their institutions without one or more of these external

stakeholders being informed and supportive.

Participants were next asked, "Does the composition of the TMT vary depending on
the issue involved?" There was consensus among all those interviewed that strategic
issues were routinely placed before them as a group for discussion in meetings of
the TMT. These issues would frequently come from the CEO or from other TMT
members. A signiﬁcant number ofissues came from the Provost to the CEO who
would then raise the issue with other members of the TMT. Within TMT meetings
issues pertaining to a particular domain (e.g., collections, serVices, fiscal resources,
facilities, etc.) would be discussed and then directed (usually by the CEO) to the
appropriate AUL or Director for their attention and action. Regarding this dynamic,

one CEO noted, "I rely on my top managers to run the day to day operations first and

63

foremost." That said, Virtually all participants noted that strategic issues are
routinely brought before the TMT in regular meetings. One TMT member (an AUL)
noted that, "we consider all issues as a group but one or more of the AULs may work

on the issue off-line making sure to route all decisions to the CEO."

One respondent highlighted the various layers of expertise that exist within his
organization and how experts at various levels who possess specialized knowledge
are often consulted on issues related to strategic decisions and how TMT members
(AULS, Directors) would 'sleuth out' these folks and on occasion help facilitate
communication among and between various teams, task forces, and committees to
acquire the information needed by the TMT on a particular issue. The TMT was
characterized by one TMT member (AUL) as being both 'consultative and
deliberative' in how it gathers information from throughout the organization to

inform discussions within the TMT on strategic matters.

While the formal shape of the TMT may remain stable when it comes to
deliberations on strategic issues, it is clear from responses to this question that TMT
members consult on an as-needed basis down into the organization and indeed
outside ofthe organization when an issue is before the TMT group. Thus, it could be
said that the symbolic shape of the TMT remains constant, but the functional shape
of the TMT may change considerably depending on the strategic issue being

addressed.

64

Another way in which the shape of the TMT changes depending on the issue being
addressed is when, for example, a Human Resources Director, who may not
normally be a member ofthe TMT, is brought into TMT discussions on
compensation or reorganization. Similarly, a Manager of Facilities, who may not
normally be a member of the TMT, is brought into TMT meetings when strategic
issues involving building renovations, new construction projects, or off-site storage
of collections are being discussed. The input of these 'consultants' or adVisors is
helpful to the TMT in considering factors that directly affect strategic directions and

the tactical aspects of implementing strategic decisions.

One organization had a more formal process in which a 'Managers Plus' group was
convened each month to address matters of strategic and operational importance.
The TMT would meet with this group on a regular basis. This blending of the TMT
with experts from other parts of the organization served in the View of one
respondent as a way to create a 'web of communication' between the various

individuals in the organization who could contribute to addressing strategic issues.

In one institution the library had formed a strategic issues working group,
composed of an AUL and various other library staff to 'set direction and strategy' on
specific library deliverables related to the university's strategic plan. This strategic
working group resided functionally between the TMT and line management with a
reporting line to the CEO. In this model, according to the CEO, the TMT is charged

with 'removing barriers' so that strategic projects can be realized.

65

TMT Meeting Frequency

Members ofthe TMTs in this study reported meeting on a regular basis as a group to
address both operational and strategic issues. Regular meetings provide a forum for
sharing information on various projects and initiatives. Meetings also provide CEOs
a setting for them to articulate strategic priorities and issues that are foremost in
his/her mind. Meetings also serve as places where complex issues are discussed,
debated and managed, where trust is established among TMT members (Simons &
Peterson, 2000) and where strategic directions are forged. These debates and
interactions (i.e., 'healthy conﬂict’), as noted by Simons, Pelled, and Smith (1999)
contribute to decision comprehensiveness and performance. Eisenhardt et. al.
(1997) point to the important role of healthy conﬂict within top management teams,
which in their View leads to "the consideration of more alternatives, a better
understanding of the choices, and overall, significantly more effective decision
making” (p. 43). Findings from this study showed that regular meetings of the TMT
are a core organizational behavior within the libraries studied. It is the place where
deliberations take place and where strategic issues are presented and discussed and
where actions are taken. While these meetings are highly valued within the libraries

in this study, ﬁndings show that TMTs meet with varying frequencies.

Demographic Characteristics of the TMT

A series of demographic questions were asked ofTMT members. These included the

number ofyears TMT members have served in their current positions (time in

tenure), in the library, in the profession, and their terminal degree. From the time

TMT members have served in the library and the time they have served in their

current positions it could be determined if and when they had been promoted and

whether the current CEO had promoted or hired them.

Time in Tenure — The average time in tenure of top management team members
(not including CEOs) is 4.3 years. The average time in tenure of top management
teams members (including CEOs) is 5.9 years. The average time in tenure of CEOs

alone is 12.6 years.

Time in Library — The average time in tenure 'in this library' of top management
team members (not including CEOs) is 10.6 years. The average time in tenure 'in
this library' of top management team members (including CEOs) is 10.78 years. The

average time in tenure of CEOs 'in this library' is 12.6 years.

Time in Profession — The average time in the profession of top management team
members (not including CEOs) is 22.8 years. The average time in the profession of
top management team members (including CEOs) is 28.6 years. The average time in

the profession of CEOs is 34.4 years.

Gender

Fifty four percent of top management team members (not including the CEO) were
women. Eight of the 15 female top management team members (53%) were
promoted into their positions by the CEO. On average, the time before promotion of
women to the top management team was 6.9 years. Six of the 15 female top
management team members (40%) were hired into their positions by the CEO. All
female TMT members promoted or hired into the top management team possessed

the MLS/MLIS degree. None possessed the PhD.

69

Forty six percent (13 of 28) of top management team members (not including the
CEO) were men. Seven of the 13 male top management team members (53.8%)
were promoted into their positions by CEOs. On average, the time before promotion
of males to the top management team was 7.8 years. Six ofthe 13 male top
management team members (46%) were hired into their positions by the CEO. All
those promoted or hired by the CEO to the top management team possessed an MLS
or MLIS. Ofmales promoted to the top management team 28.5% possessed the
MLS/MLIS and the PhD. Of men hired into the top management team by the CEO

33.3% possessed a PhD.

Findings revealed that approximately the same percentage of men and women were
promoted into the top management teams studied. About half of the men and
women brought into top management teams were promoted from within
organizations and about halfwere brought in from outside of organizations. On
average, women were promoted slightly sooner (6.9 years) as compared to men (7.8
years). Approximately the same percentage of both women and men were hired into
their positions by CEOs. One difference between men and women promoted or hired
into top management teams is that 28.5% of men promoted and 33.3% of men hired
into top management teams possessed a PhD, while 100% of women promoted or
hired into top management team roles possessed the MLS/MLIS degree but not the

PhD.

Part 2: Strategic Decisions

Participants were asked to identify two strategic decisions the library has made in
the past three years. They were then asked a series of sub-questions about each

issue, including:

a) How did the issue come to your attention?

b) Who was involved in the decision?

c) Were documents provided, generated, created, or shared?
d) What was your specific role in the decision?

e) How satisﬁed were you with the outcome?

f) Was there agreement within the TMT on the final decision?

(Prompts for these sub-questions are found in Appendix 1.)

Framing Definitions

To provide a context for selecting two strategic issues, two deﬁnitions of strategic
decision-making were shared with respondents. The ﬁrst states, "a strategic
decision is deﬁned as being important in terms of the actions taken, the resources
committed, or the precedent set." (Mintzburg et. al., 1976). The second characterizes
strategic decisions as, "those infrequent decisions made by the top leaders of an

organization that critically affect organizational health and survival." (Eisenhardt &

71

Zbarecki, 1992). While more varied or nuanced deﬁnitions exist, these deﬁnitions
provided a useful frame of reference for respondents to use to identify the strategic

decisions they cited as important.

The 65 * strategic decisions cited by 34 respondents varied covering the range of
functional aspects of library work, including, on one end of the spectrum, activities
related to the various library departments, and on the other end of the spectrum,
decisions related to fundamental changes to the library's business model. Issues also
ranged from those that came to the library from within the organization to those
that came to the library from the external environment, for example from boards,
administrators, and faculty committees. Still other issues seem to be connected to
factors beyond the university, such as the economy, vendors, and donors. Below is a
list of the strategic decisions respondents identified classiﬁed by type.

Given the changing nature oflibraries from being repositories of books to being
engaged learning spaces that provide a multitude of services in support of learning,
teaching and research it is not surprising that CEOs cited space as a top issue. The
tension to create more study space for students is countered by the continued inﬂux
of collections, including special collections, and new acquisitions of materials in
print and audio-Visual formats, a trend that shows no signs of abating. CEOs are
often faced with negotiating for space to accommodate both needs, and they do so in
an environment where academic programs and co curricular interests compete for
finite space resources on campus. This study found that in addition to these tensions
— or perhaps as a result of them — CEOs were increasingly exploring off-site storage

for collections. Indeed universities in general are moving non-essential services and

76

 

personnel off campus to make room for classrooms and critical co curricular

functions. The libraries in this study to varying degrees are swept up in this vortex.

That serVice, collection and ﬁnance-related issues were also Viewed as important is
not surprising: libraries are serVice organizations that facilitate access to knowledge
resources and serve students' and faculty members information seeking and
research needs by providing sustained access to print and digital collections
through a myriad of coordinated services. These services require steady revenue
streams to be sustainable. Each of the public institutions in this study has
experienced the effects of economic belt tightening at the state and national levels.

The CEOs and top managers in these institutions commented on this reality.

Frequent citation of organizational issues as a strategic concern speaks loudly to the
soul searching and reinventing that certain libraries in the study are experiencing
today to create the right mix of collections, services and personnel to meet the
changing needs of library users. The trend to critically examine traditional library
structures and organizational schema may be reﬂective of a larger trend in

academic libraries today.

The identification of services as a top cited strategic decision category for TMT

members (not including the CEO) is not particularly surprising as most if not all of

the top managers interviewed oversee operational aspects within their libraries and

78

 

many of these aspects are serVice-related. Thus, it is expected that these managers

would cite serVice-related issues.

TMT Member Co-Citation on Strategic Issues

While citation of issues related to strategic decision making produced an expected
range of issues, one aspect of the findings that was not anticipated was that in some
cases top management team members cited the same strategic issues. The table

below shows instances in which TMT members cited the same strategic issue (s).

The distribution of issues co-cited by top managers Viewed through the topics they
fall under reveals a shared strategic concern for issues pertaining to the health of
the organizations in which top managers work, financial issues, and space and
services. Co-citation around organizational issues reﬂects a shared concern among
the libraries in this study to adjust, refine, and in some cases completely change
their organizational design to meet the changing needs of academic departments,
schools, and library users. Co-citation on issues ofa financial nature reﬂects
libraries' concern with operating effectively in a budget—constrained environment.
Indeed, several of the public institutions in this study have experienced dramatic
budget cuts that have forced them to rethink their serVice models. Privates in this
study have not been immune from the economic downturn that began in 2 008 and

continues to impact endowments and operational budgets. Several libraries in this

80

 

study reported being caught up in university-wide efforts to increase efﬁciencies
across campuses, including, for example, initiatives to reduce costs through the
consolidation of services, such as information technology. Concerns about space are
a perennial concern on all campuses. Space is in short supply and high demand.
Libraries engage in the ﬁght for space to accommodate collections, people, and
services. In this sense, co-citation on issues of space does not surprise. Ofsome
interest is that collections and services, two stalwart strategic offerings of libraries
in academic settings, fall to the bottom of the co-citation list. The seeming de-
emphasis of these traditional aspects of library serVices may reﬂect libraries' shift to
new concerns that are more focused on creating new, sustainable organizations that

are situated more centrally in the ﬂow of learning and and teaching on campuses.

Defining Co-Citation

Co-citation is a similarity measure used by researchers in the field of library and
information science. By definition, co-citation in a bibliometric context refers to
instances when two or more documents 'appear simultaneously in the reference list
of a third document.’ (Nicolaisen, 2006) Co-citation frequency refers to the
frequency with which two documents are cited together. The related concept of
bibliographic coupling, is used to establish relationships between two documents.
For example, two documents are coupled if they both cite one or more documents in
common. Co-citation and bibliographic coupling a can be motivated by a variety of
factors, including but not limited to authors' relationships with other authors, an

author's desire to recognize the works of eminent people in the field, or the

81

identification of works that relate directly to the an author's particular research

inquiry.

Co-citation in the context of this research on top management teams in academic
libraries is deﬁned as when one or more members 0fthe top management team

iden tijj/ strategic issues in common. The reason why this is an important factor is that
when co-citation of strategic issues is present it provides evidence that there is a
shared awareness within the TMT of issues of strategic importance. Of particular
note, is when co-citation of an issue occurs between a CEO and a top manager, in
particular when a top manager cites the same issue as their CEO. When this
condition is present, it provides evidence that the top manager is closely aligned
with the CEO on issues the CEO Views as strategically important. This alignment is
indicative that the top manager is being involved in strategic issues and through this
involvement receiving on-the-job experience to assume an executive leadership

role.

Co-citation of the same issue by two TMT members within the same institution may
suggest that individual TMT members View the cited issue as strategically
important. It may also mean that the issue has been discussed within the context of
the TMT and earmarked by TMT members as of strategic importance. Multiple
citations ofthe same issue or issues by TMT members may also be indicative ofa
shared understanding within the leadership team of issues that rise to the level of

strategic as opposed to those that are operational or occasional. Ofnote in this

82

study are instances when issues that were cited by the CEO as strategically
important were also cited by one or more members of the TMT. The citation of
issues by TMT members that are also cited by the chief executive suggests a close
alignment in thinking within the TMT between citing members and the CEO. When,
as in the case of one institution, 3 of4 TMT members and the CEO cite the same
issue it suggests a high level of agreement among the TMT on what is considered
strategic. Thus, the presence of co-citation among these various members of the
TMT is an important TMT dynamic that is indicative of a shared understanding of

issues of strategic importance.

TMT Member and CEO Co-Citation on Strategic Issues

Further examination of the presence of co-citation invites looking at the frequency
with which top management team members co-cite issues with the CEO and the
types ofissues they co-cite. This examination is important because it may be an
indicator that the top manager and the CEO share a Vision on issues that rise to the
level of being strategically important. This shared View of issues of strategic
importance is indicative that the top manager comprehends big picture issues that
are also Viewed by the CEO as strategically important. This awareness of big picture
issues and involvement with them in the context of the TMT is important evidence
that top managers are being 'brought along' to assume leadership roles in academic

libraries.

Top managers and CEOs tended to co-cite issues pertaining to organizational health,
services and space as their first choice of important strategic issue. The second
category of co-citation heaVily favored issues of a financial nature, followed by
collections and services. If one compiles the instances of co-citation between TMT
members and CEOs the results line up remarkably well with the instances of co-
citation within the TMT generally. Indeed the ranking order of co-citation topics
among TMT members and co-citations with CEOs is remarkably similar as can be
seen below.

Financial, organizational, space, and serVice matters comprise the set of concerns
that CEOs in this study identified as high priority strategic issues and which select

top managers also found of strategic importance. The relatively high percent of co-

85

 

 

citing TMT members is suggestive of a shared understanding within the TMT of
issues of strategic importance. But what explains the presence of a significant

number of co-citations with the CEO?

TMT Member Co-Citation and TMT Member Promotion

One possible answer to this question comes from looking at key demographic
attributes within the TMT. One attribute that may provide insight into why top
managers cite the same issues as CEOs is whether the co-citing top manager was
hired or promoted by the CEO. In such cases, it may be that the CEO promoted a top
manager because the CEO perceived in that person particular attributes that could
be developed within the context of the top management team. It could be that as
managers are recruited into top management, they enter a culture in which they are
expected to pay particular attention to strategic issues affecting the organization
rather than solely those issues that affect the day-to-day departmental operations.
Participants in this study on multiple occasions mentioned the 'shift’ they
experience from being a line manager to being an administrator once they become a
TMT member. This change is significant in terms of a manager's self—identity and in
terms of the roles the manager is expected to play and the issues a manager is
expected to pay attention to. Co-citation with a CEO suggests a top manager's
awareness of particular strategic issues is present; that there is a cognitive
alignment with the CEOs sense of what is important. Thus, when a top manager has
been promoted or hired by a CEO and co-cites with that CEO issues of strategic

importance, it may is a strong indicator that these top managers are, through

86

exposure and involvement in issues deemed of strategic importance by the CEO,

gaining critically important on-the-job training that will prepare them to assume

executive leadership roles in academic libraries.

The following table presents instances in which a TMT member and a CEO cite the

same issue and if that TMT member was hired by or promoted into their position by

that CEO, along with gender data.

As discussed above, co-citation between TMT members and CEOs suggests a TMT
member's cognitive alignment with the CEO, which can be Viewed as evidence that
that TMT member is in alignment with the CEO on issues the CEO Views as
strategically important. This alignment is an indicator that a TMT member is being
brought into discussions on strategic matters and thus indicative that a TMT
member is being 'brought along’ by the CEO to acquire the skills and experience

necessary for executive leadership.

As we look closely at those individuals who co-cited issues with the CEO and were
promoted or hired by that executive, what demographic characteristics emerge?
Eight ofthe twelve co-citing TMT members were promoted into their positions by
their CEOs; four were hired into their positions by their CEOs. The mean time in
tenure of co-citing top managers was 3.9 years. (See Appendix 8) The mean time in
the profession of co-citing top managers was 14 years. There did not appear to be

differences between public and private institutions on these characteristics.

Twelve top managers (8 female/ 4 male) co-cited 13 specific issues in common with
their CEOs. The cohort of co-citers was split evenly between public and private
institutions. There were no co-citations in one private institution. One TMT member
co-cited both of the CEO's top strategic issues. Other instances of co-citation tended
to cluster around one of the strategic issues cited by the CEO (e.g., financial,
organizational, services, etc.). The types ofissues co-cited in ranked order, appear

directly below.

The presence of co-citation with CEOs on issues of strategic importance by 42.8%
(12 of 28 top managers) of TMT suggests the existence of a culture within the
academic library top management teams studied in which there is a shared
understanding between top managers and CEOs on issues of strategic importance.
Exactly how this cognitive alignment occurs--whether through one-on-one projects
with the CEO, through exposure to particular issues in TMT meetings, or other

means--is not known.

One indicator that may shed light on this question is whether the co-citing top
manager was promoted or hired by the CEO. Data from this study found that all but
one of the co-citing managers were either promoted by or hired by their CEOs. It
may well be that CEOs recruit and promote those who they see as possessing the

acumen to align with executive thinking. In this sense CEOs may be said to be

89

 

bringing along top managers in very intentional ways by hiring smart people, giVing
them access to executive concerns and priorities through various means and giVing
them the latitude to address strategic issues individually or as part of the top
management team. This involvement is strongly indicative that chief executive
ofﬁcers (CEOs) in academic and research libraries are involving their top
management team (TMT) members in strategic decision making that affects
organizational performance, and, that involvement is preparing top managers to

assume leadership positions as CEOs.

Findings from this study indicate that there is: 1) considerable agreement among
top management team members in both public and private institutions on issues
considered to be of strategic importance; 2) eVidence that TMT members and CEOs
in both public and private institutions agree to some extent on issues that are of
strategic importance; and 3) evidence that all TMT members citing issues in

common with CEOs were either promoted or hired by that CEO.

Sub Questions Related to Strategic Decisions
Once participants had identified two strategic issues, each were then asked a series
of related sub-questions for each issue. The ﬁrst of these was "How did the strategic

issue come to your attention?" Responses to this question are represented below.

For public institutions, respondents tended to rank first those strategic decisions
that impacted the library from other parts of the university. Strategic issues of
secondary importance tended to be generated from within the library. In some cases
issues are linked, such as the case in one library that was given a directive to create
more usable study space for students (Issue #1 for that respondent) which resulted
in a weeding of the collections (Issue #2 for that respondent) to create the desired
study space. Reductions to the library's budget can have a cascade effect that
directly inﬂuences strategic decisions, including in the case of one library studied, in
which economic exigencies hastened the implementation of aspects of a strategic
plan. As a TMT member from that institution said, "the library took on a reduced

budget as a strategic opportunity to reconfigure and downsize...to become a leaner

91

library." Another respondent, from the same library who cited the budget cuts as a
motivation for a strategic decision, noted that the state-driven budget cuts to the
university forced the library to adopt a new serVice model. In one institution, state
budget cuts coupled with reduced external funding for a capital project required the
CEO to work closely with campus partners to reduce the projected budget on an
important library renovation. This resizing process enabled the project to remain

alive.

In several cases strategic issues for libraries arose from the faculty. In one ofthese
cases, faculty reacted to a plan prepared by the library in response to ﬂagging
resources during an economic downturn. Faculty reactions to the plan served to
direct substantial additional funding to the library from central administration
while also inﬂuencing the library's strategic priorities in the process.

92

For private institutions, strategic issues tend to come from the CEO to the TMT.
External forces (such as the economy, space politics, campus priorities, etc.) may be
behind strategic issues, but the CEO is usually cited as the one who brings the issue

to the TMT.

Participation

The next sub-question, "Who participated in the decision making process?" was
asked of each participant to identify those individuals who were involved in
discussions about the strategic issues cited. Individual responses to this question
are found in Appendix 4 sorted by public and private institutions. Specific issues are
coded according to the table found above on pages 72 & 73. Individuals beyond the
TMT who were involved are coded according to the table found directly below this

section.

Contrary to some commonly held Views of leadership in hierarchies that
characterize top managers as working behind closed doors in isolation to craft
strategy and then announcing decisions to subordinates who carry out the work,
responses to this question, by academic library top managers, identified a wide
range of actors who contributed to strategic work often in open, collaborative ways.
The TMT members in this study reported being involved in the specific issues they
cited to varying degrees. Actions that place strategic decisions before TMTs may

originate from outside the library or indeed from outside the campus. Findings on

93

this question reﬂect the rather broad and diverse array of individuals with whom
TMT members reported working with once an issue was raised within the context of

TMT deliberations.

Individuals, with whom TMT members consulted, collaborated, conferred, sought
input from, and in some cases directly involved in key decisions, include persons
from both inside and outside the library. Internal participants include, for example,
library supervisors, library selectors, and technical services staff. External
participants include, for example, attorneys, consultants, and architects. Of the 42
examples of participants involved in strategic issues that TMT members identified,

55% were internal to the library and 45% were external to the library.

Responses to this question provide evidence that rarely does the TMT alone make
strategic decisions. Issues of strategic concern tend to be addressed by clusters of
individuals who carry out their work gathering data, compiling reports, assessing
impact, and then this information is reported back to the TMT or to perhaps only
one or two members of the team. These individuals then will typically brief the CEO,
or bring the ﬁndings to the whole TMT for discussion, deliberation and action.
Strategic decisions might involve one or more TMT members and select individuals
from outside the TMT who act as adVisors to the TMT or to the CEO, as well as
middle managers whose feedback is useful in gauging the impact or potential impact

of strategic decisions on organizational performance.

94

Documentation

A third sub-question, "Was documentation provided, created, generated or shared?"
was asked that invited participants to identify documents which may have been
helpful to the TMT in their deliberations. The thinking here is that the presence of
documents being provided, created, generated, shared, is indicative of a ﬂow of
information related to the strategic issue. Full responses to this question are found

in Appendix 5.

Responses to this question confirmed that strategic decisions often do involve the
copious production of documents and in many cases these documents are shared
with TMT members and with others in the library and in the university. The sharing
of documents within the TMT in particular is indicative of a certain degree of
'information ﬂow' present in the strategic decision-making process. While the
extent to which these documents are being archived was not explicitly asked,
respondents volunteered on numerous occasions that the organization of
documents (description, arrangement, preservation) for future access was not a

specific library priority.

TMT Members' Roles

A fourth sub-question, 'What role did you play in the decision-making process?" was

asked of participants as a way of delVing more deeply into the dynamics within the

95

TMT to gain insight into the specific roles participants played regarding strategic

decisions. Abbreviated responses to this question are found in Appendix 6.

Specific Roles of CEOs

Some key differences were observed between the roles of CEOs who worked in
public institutions and those who worked in private institutions. CEOs in public
institutions tended to focus a great deal on goal setting, managing information ﬂow
within organizations, communicating the Vision to staff, 'keeping spirits of staff up',
delegating to TMT members, and encouraging staff. Accordingly, building projects,
collection consolidation efforts, and organizational redesigns were top issues for

CEOs in the public institutions examined.

CEOs in private institutions tended to devote a great deal of time to working with
individuals external to the library, including vendors, consultants, and funders. They
also tended to devote considerable time to charging TMTs with project
responsibilities and advocating for projects with constituents. As might be expected,
asset development, the introduction of new services ﬁnanced by private sources, the
establishment of new serVices marketed to constituents, and changes to the library's
core portfolio offerings were top issues for CEOs in the private institutions

examined.

Specific Roles of Top Managers

96

Approximately half of the TMT members in public institutions reported (in
reference to their first strategic decision) that they worked with units outside of the
library (e.g., "represented the library to the university community"; "worked closely
with the academic affairs ofﬁce", etc.). The remaining TMT members tended to
discuss their roles carrying out specific tasks, sometimes associated with high-
proﬁle projects. For example, one TMT member noted, "I was the lead on closing an
important branch library." Other task-oriented duties were also noted, for example,
one TMT member noted, "I developed a white paper on 'what if scenarios related to

our reorganization project." Another individual noted brieﬁng the dean prior to an

important meeting with other deans.

Within private institutions, the roles played by TMTs ranged from managing
internal affairs by working closely with other TMT members and line managers, to
serving on search committees, to assuming a leadership role in designing and
carrying out projects, to representing the library at external meetings on particular
issues (e.g., linked data, shared storage of print materials, etc.). As one TMT member
from a private institution noted of his role, "I was manager for the project. [In that
capacity] I worked with the Human Resources Department, the Chief Financial
Officer, and with departmental managers." I also, "pulled together key information
and made decisions to move the project along." A TMT member in another private
institution cited his administrative role: "I played an administrative role to keep the
whole project moving forward; handled intellectual property issues; and worked

closely with other TMT member on management aspects." Another TMT cited a

97

similar role: "I heard concerns, considered impact, decided what would get done

when."

Of particular interest in relation to the central research question of this study (e.g.,
To what extent are chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) in academic and research
libraries involving their top management team (TMT) members in strategic decision
making that affects organizational performance, and, the extent to which this
involvement is preparing top managers to assume leadership positions as CEOs?)
are the roles played by top managers who cited strategic issues in common with the
CEO and were either hired or promoted by that CEO. What can we learn from how
the CEOs characterized their roles on issues and how top managers characterized
their roles? Is there a common thread to these self—characterizations that further
supports the assertion that top managers are aligned with CEOs on strategic issues?
Below is a table of the self—described functions and roles of co-citing CEOs and top

managers drawn from the strategic issues discussed by respondents.

Within two of the organizations studied (1&2 above) we ﬁnd CEOs functioning
principally as communicators. The emphasis that these CEOs place on
communication as an important functional role is mirrored by the respective co-
citing top managers. A third CEO stated his role as a delegator. Co-citing top
managers in this library reported taking on administrative and managerial roles to
carry out the CEO's directives. A fourth CEO characterized his role as a decision
maker focused on working with various external partners. For this strategic issue,
co-citing top managers also reported working with external partners. The sixth CEO
(n.b. co-citation was not found in one institution) characterized her role as
advocating for the library with constituents external to the library. This outward
facing work was strongly reﬂected in the functional roles that co-citing top
managers reported, which included liaising with faculty, working with consultants,

and collaborating with university partners.

In each of these cases we ﬁnd evidence that co-citing top managers are aligned with
their CEOs on the roles and functions important for successfully addressing the
strategic issues in question. In some cases roles and functions are mirrored exactly

by co-citing top managers (e.g., communication, working with external partners). In

99

 

other cases we see top managers' roles as extensions ofa CEO's functional role (e.g.,

carrying out directives, sharing the Vision).

A final sub-question was asked of participants regarding the strategic issues they
selected to discuss. It was: "Was there agreement among decision makers on the
way forward?" Responses to this question on the whole fell into two broad
categories. One category was either a quick yes or no. The other category offered
more nuanced responses, such as "we agreed to come to consensus" or "opinions on
the outcome were mixed, but we agreed to move ahead with the decision for the
good of the library" As one TMT member stated, "It was a decision I could live with
and I know that while it wasn't my preferred direction, it was one that was best for
the library at this time." That sentiment was repeated with some frequency by TMT
members, and reﬂected a kind of emotional intelligence (Kreitz, 2009) that is found
in top management teams characterized by the willingness to put aside operational

identities and personal preferences for the good of the organization as a whole.

Library Organizational Performance Metrics: Measuring Success

To better understand ways in which TMT members measure library performance
and in turn ways in which that performance is tied to organizational effectiveness,
the question, "How does your library measure success?" was asked. There were
wide-ranging responses to this question from gathering and counting transaction
statistics (gate counts, items circulated, downloads, etc.) to faculty impressions of

the library, to how university executives spoke publically about the library.

100

Summary responses to the question are found below sorted by CEOs in public and
private institutions and TMT members in public and private organizations.

Complete responses to how success is measured are found in Appendix 3.

CEOs in Public Institutions

CEOs reﬂected carefully on the question of how they measure organizational success
and offered insights that reﬂect the changing role of the library within the academy.
For example, one CEO from a public institution remarked, "We continue to use old
input and output measures (transaction statistics); they are good indicators, but are
not particularly signiﬁcant in terms of telling the story of how the library has an
inﬂuence on student success." He added, we also gather qualitative data from
surveys and these are increasing more useful, but we are challenged (but interested
in) gathering quantitative data around student success that is linked to library use.
At some point we hope to carry out longitudinal studies that track student success
over time with regard to the library." A CEO from another public institution took a
rather different View, noting the importance of preserving the value of the library as
place, observing, "Physical use of the library is an important metric. If people are
using the library in various ways it is a 'sign of Vitality.' When they come they are
essentially, 'Voting with their feet.’ Should students shun libraries and ﬂock to social
clubs and unions I believe that would be a bad thing." Yet another CEO from a public
institution noted a very wide range of metrics that the institution uses to check the

pulse on how they are doing. He noted, "We have and currently make great use of

101

ARL stats, and comparative statistics from a subset of ARL institutions we consider
peers of sorts. During a recent budget crisis we looked at how many library dollars
per student were being made available. We also pay attention to longitudinal
comparisons regarding percentages spent on collections or staff. Additionally,
digital metrics such as tweets, re-tweets, program downloads, e newsletters sent,

downloads of articles are useful indicators of how we are doing."

CEOs in Private Institutions

CEOs from private institutions provided insightful responses to this question as
well. One director noted, "ARL statistics are interesting but not deﬁnitive. We are
working with a private funder to develop new benchmark and assessment methods
and a strategy. This is very interesting to our provost and president." This CEO then
remarked, "One way we measure success is by the lack of complaints." He added
that his organization achieves this by, "always changing the mix of services, being
innovative, and addressing student and faculty needs... by anticipating needs, high
level of interactions with faculty and department chairs, and committees, and by
testing solutions before deploying them" and finally, "we respond quickly when we
do get complaints." He added that at his university there "isn't a culture of strategic
planning, it is opportunistic." A chief executive from another private university
library responded to the question with two words: 'Happy faculty.’ She elaborated,
"I measure success by how well we are received at annual budget meetings.
Measurements of success are sometimes tangible, sometimes not. I can look at funds

raised, or some other things, but these are not always telling. A political success is

102

sometimes the best success, how we are perceived, who was pleased. If the general
level of complaints is low that is an indicator we are doing things right, satisfying
our users. The opinion of the provost counts as well, especially when he shares
positive Views about the library publically and with colleagues. Success sometimes
occurs when budget increases come automatically after years of making the case."
A third CEO remarked that, "We have a formal process of assessment that is tied to
the university's strategic plan. The library has adopted numerous goals that align
with that plan." He added, we don't care about ARL statistics. We are what we are
and really don't compare ourselves to others. No one has ever asked us where we
stand in the ARL rankings. We only have 20K students and no Law school. So far

people here are happy and we are happy (and doing well)."

TMT members responded to this question in a slightly more granular way, noting
the signiﬁcant time people under their direction spend collecting transaction
statistics, survey data, and other forms of feedback from constituents as to gauge
success. While it was reported by TMT members that considerable types of data
(transactions, gate counts, etc.), are being collected, compiled reviewed, and
compared, it was not clear from respondents exactly how these data were being

used to improve performance.

TMT Members in Public Institutions

TMT members in public institutions cited the collection of transaction statistics for

the purpose of production trend analysis within institutions and benchmarking with

103

peer and aspirational institutions. Off-the-shelf products are used to log and
manage these data. Professional development activities undertaken by librarians
are also tracked, especially in those institutions that have a rank and promotion
system for librarians. One TMT member in a public institution noted, that "even
though we are not an ARL library, we track ARL trends, statistics and current issues
that reﬂect interest within the ARL community." Providing a more application-
specific response to the question, one TMT member noted, that, "metrics need to be
tied to local performance issues. They need to be tied directly to patrons and reﬂect

what the local student population is saying about the library."

TMT members to a large degree acknowledge the value of the ARL statistics as a
robust data set that they routinely pay attention to. Less clear was how examination
of comparative data from the ARL statistics are assessed locally and in turn how or if
these data inﬂuence strategic thinking or provide the TMT with insight into

performance at the local level.

At one public institution, it was noted that faculty are increasingly becoming aware
of library rankings. Noted one TMT member, "even thought we are a leading
research library, a faculty member in a department wants to know why the library
isn't ranked number one [among libraries]." Another TMT member from the same
institution noted, "faculty really want to hang their hats on ARL data, but library
faculty are increasingly skeptical of whether the ARL stats are useful metrics to

assess how impactful libraries are in the lives of students and faculty. No one wants

104

to fall in rankings but there are other factors to consider. We look at the ARL stats
because the faculty have adopted these metrics, in fact we spend a good deal of time
explaining to our faculty that the ARL statistics don't tell the whole story, it is a more
complex and nuanced picture than what the rankings and pure numbers show. We
want to ask about a lot of other things, for example, for those who spend time in the
library, how does that affect their academic performance. How are we doing? How
are we contributing, these are the key questions we should be asking. Counting
things simply doesn't tell the story especially as libraries count things in different

ways."

TMT members at another public institution found the ARL statistics of use when
embarking on a reorganization of the library. The statistics from peer libraries
provided this library with useful comparative data in staffing sizes and budgets to
help them understand what was 'reasonable.’ Another TMT member from the same
institution observed, "we look at ARL stats, and we invest a lot in compiling these
numbers, but more and more we are looking at other metrics, such as usage of
facilities, serVices, and resources. For years, we have collected these data that show
Visitors, transactions and so forth. Now we are looking at what that means in terms
of the impact we are having, the integration of the library into the university. We are
probably the norm, in that we would like to come up with better ways to gauge

success. "

105

TMT Members in Private Institutions

TMT members in private institutions also expressed an interest in exploring new
ways to assess library impact within the university and a means of gauging
organizational success beyond counting transactions, comparing budgets, and
comparing aspects of current operations with peer and cohort institutions. One TMT
member noted, "our work is changing and much of what we do is not reﬂected in
any statistics. For example, in my work we are asked to do mapping from one
metadata standard to another; that [activity] produces a huge intellectual output but
no numbers that can be easily counted and compared with other institutions. It is
hard to tally these things." Another TMT member observed, "the library is currently
in the process of coming up with a new way of measuring success; a new
framework. There is a lot of dissatisfaction with the current way of counting things.
One component of the new way will be to better know how [the library's) resources
are speciﬁcally being used by scholars." A colleague added, "We plan to look at some
new ways of documenting the value that libraries add to the university and to
academic life. We collect statistics but we probably don't deploy them very much." A
colleague TMT member added, "We've long since gotten away from gate counts and
volume counts as a way of gauging success." Instead, we try to look at the level of
innovative work we have done with patrons, and we try to measure our success
from the feedback we are receiving from our users." We have talked about doing an
annual survey; the committee on libraries (faculty and a few students) has been a
helpful sounding board; we try to look back on projects where we assess from

hindsight our key successes. We measure success by the extent to which we are

106

having a positive impact on users, being innovative and forward thinking,...the

library of the future, not the past."

A TMT member who oversees Special Collections notes an example where
transactions statistics help provide the basis for understanding how the library
supports research. He noted, "I pay attention to how many items are paged per year.
If you have 8-9000 items a year, that is impressive. Plus the anecdotal feedback.
Another variable for success is seeing the [high] volume of scholarship that is taking
place with our collections by scholars outside of our institution. This speaks to our
global reach. For example, 75% of our users are not from our institution. Online
access to collections through finding aids is increasing this trend. Other measures of
success include the increasing number of classes being taught in special collections

and dissertations being produced by researchers using the collections."

Within the disciplines, as noted with faculty in public institutions, there is increasing
interest in the library be ranked highly, particularly if the university or the academic
program within the university is highly ranked. Faculty sees a 'disconnect’ when

their academic program is a leader and the library that supports that program is not.

A newly recruited member of one TMT noted, that traditional statistics "don't reﬂect
how we are impacting teaching and learning." Of all those who responded to the
question of measuring success, this respondent was the only TMT member who

asked this: "How do we measure leadership?" She added, we must learn to use the

107

data we collect in new ways, for example tracking citations of scholars using our
collections." We don't take the data at face value—we ask more questions about it
and look at indicators that support our primary goal as being a resource for our

community."

One TMT member in a private institution noted the recent recruitment of an
assessment librarian as helpful to the library in developing new ways of measuring
its impact on the learning and research communities it serves. Within this
organization, an assessment committee has been formed that looks at qualitative
and quantitative data, including web analytics. The TMT member reporting on these
activities, noted, "in that group, we tend to pull that info together and it goes to the

TMT for reView. I think this will help us better assess student learning."

The limitations of certain types of comparative data were noted by one TMT
member, who observed, "for budget requests we used to look at dollars spent on
libraries per student as compared to our peers." She noted that, "This year at the
budget hearings they said 'stop telling us that' which encouraged us to look for other
data points that would better tell our story." She added, "we look at the ARL
investment index and we are near the bottom, yet this doesn't get the attention of
higher ups. What matters most is whether the students are satisfied and faculty is

getting what they need."

108

While respondents mentioned the practice of looking at peer data there was
uniform agreement in the limitations of doing this. One TMT observed a shortfall of
this approach: "Peer institution lists are ﬂawed as no two institutions are really very
much alike. Even within our peer group we are outliers because most members are
large state institutions and we are a small private institution." A ﬁner point was put
on the exercise of comparative analytics by one TMT member who said, "The
university as a whole does not value the library anywhere to the extent that our

peers do."

A rather more pragmatic View of how the library measures success was offered by
one TMT member who noted, "we measure success by what our funders think of us."
Another TMT member from the same institution cited the extent to which the
library's key performance measures were met as a measure of success. These line
up with strategic performance expectations at the university level. The TMT
member added, "yes, we typically report gate count, circulation, and instruction
statistics, but I am not sure they tell the right story. I have never been satisﬁed with
these measures. Who knows if what was taught in an instruction session makes a
difference in a student's life in the long term. " Another TMT member cited the lack
on accountability on the input side as a missing element in the equation of
measuring ROI for types of work carried out in the library. Pointing the social
stratification that exists in libraries and the challenges of engaging these cultures
around a common goal, one TMT member mentioned, "we track transactions, such

as items lent or borrowed, but to my mind they don't tell the story. There are micro

109

cultures in the library and each have their own way of measuring success. I am
asked to share my successes with the CEO each year. I am not sure there is much
agreement within the TMT on what this looks like."

Mentors

TMT members were asked if they have or have ever had a mentor, someone who has
inﬂuenced them, advised them, or helped them in their vocational call to be a
librarian. This question was posed to get a sense from the CEO's perspective and
from the TMT members' perspectives if mentoring was part of their formative
experiences as a librarian. An overwhelming majority of TMT members in public
institutions (91%) stated that they had indeed had a mentor at some stage in their
career. A signiﬁcant number of these subjects (73%) cited their mentors as
librarians who were their senior (e.g., a university librarian for whom they worked,
a dean of libraries at another institution senior to them, etc.). Interestingly, only
9.1% of TMT members cited their current CEOs as their mentors. Additionally,
100% ofindiViduals promoted into TMT positions from within their organizations
were promoted by CEOs who reported that they had had a mentor who signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced them in their development as executives. The extent to which these
mentoring experiences remain with top managers as schema that shapes their Views
of mentoring others or expectations of being mentored is not known, but an inquiry

that invites future work as related to the central focus of this research.

TMT Member Identity

110

To better understand ways in which TMT members characterized themselves, the
following question was asked: "In a word or two please describe your functional
role within your organization?’ One expectation was that given the changes that
libraries are going through these days, self-descriptions would be wildly variable.
Surprisingly, participants tended to describe themselves in rather traditional ways.
Of some interest is the way in which some TMT members who oversaw speciﬁc
operational areas (e.g., technical services, etc.) either identified with that particular
operation, or, identified themselves as 'administrators' For example, CEOs in public
institutions (n=3) each characterized themselves as administrators. CEOs in private
institutions (n=3) tended to think of themselves in rather more expansive ways (e.g.,
leadership and relationships, articulating a Vision; strategic problem solver, coach;

Connector — putting the right people together).

Of the 13 (non-CEO) TMT members (out of 28 total) (46%) who had been hired or
promoted by their CEO and who cited at least one of the same strategic issues as
cited by CEOs in their institutions, 8 of these individuals (62%) described

themselves as 'administrators.’ The other five individuals in this group described

 

themselves around the portfolios they manage (e.g., technical services, IT, etc.).

CHAPTER 5: DISCUSSION

Introduction

This chapter considers findings drawn from the data gathered in Chapter 4 above,
and in particular how these data address the central thesis of this research that
CEOS are bringing along top managers to assume positions ofleadership through
participation in strategic decision-making in the library. This chapter begins with a
sketch of organizational types to provide a point of orientation for the reader,
followed by observations about changes that are impacting traditional library
organization models, including those brought about by changing user expectations
and demographic shifts within libraries. A discussion of strategic decision-making
follows in which some background and commentary is first offered on the
emergence of business concepts, such as strategic planning, and their application in

academic settings.

This backdrop provides a context for a discussion of ﬁndings with emphasis on the
implications of those related to co-citation ofissues by one or more TMT members
and co-citation ofissues by TMT members and the CEOs as indicators of strategic
alignment within top management teams. These cognitive indicators strongly

support the thesis of this research that CEOs are bringing along top managers.

The discussion next turns to measures of success and metrics used by top managers

and CEOs. A brief discussion of aspects of the TMT such as identity, interactions,

112

team building strategies and composition, are next offered to provide a cultural
context in which top managers operate. These variables are examined in relation to

their inﬂuence on strategic decision-making.

Organizational Types
Mintzberg (1990) describes the manager's role and the core activities managers
carry out to be effective under a variety of circumstances and within various
organizational settings. He also maps out the various types of structures commonly

found in organizations, including their shortcomings and attributes. 5 They are:

The Entrepreneurial Organization

This type of organization has a simple, ﬂat structure. Typically, it consists of one
large unit with one or more top managers. It is unstructured and can appear
informal compared with other types of organizations. The entrepreneurial
organization is 'fast, ﬂexible, and lean'. Many companies emulate this model for its
perceived adaptability and ﬂexibility. One of the vulnerabilities associated with
entrepreneurial organizations is that as they grow decision-makers at the top can
become so overwhelmed that they start making bad decisions. This is the point at
which they are forced to share decision-making power and how this done may

disrupt the organizational ethos. There is also a business continuity risk within

 

5 Mintzberg notes that while these constructs are useful in identifying the attributes of organizations, that "the
effective organization will favor some sort of configuration — some type of a logically consistent clustering of its
elements — as it searches for harmony in its internal processes and consonance with its environment."
(Mintzberg,1980 p. 322)

113

organizations like this in that as CEOs retire or move out ofthe organization a

leadership vacuum may result.

The Machine Organization

The machine organization is a tight vertically structured bureaucracy in which work
is very formalized. Routines and procedures are standardized, decision-making is
centralized, and tasks are grouped by departments that carry out specific functions.
Jobs are well documented and clearly defined. Typically there are standardized
formal planning processes in place and procedures are regularly analyzed and
assessed for efficiency purposes. One of the pitfalls of machine organizations is that
the emphasis on formalization can lead to specialization and this can create
'stovepipes' within the organization that develop goals that are in conﬂict with other

units in the organization which may not align with or support corporate objectives.

The Professional Organization

The professional organization is also very bureaucratic, but the essential difference
between the two is that professional organizations rely on 'highly trained
professionals who demand control of their own work.’ In these organizations there
are high levels of specialization, and decision-making is diffuse. This model is
typically found in knowledge organizations, such as universities, schools, and law
firms. Typically, professional organizations are reasonably complex and rely on the
rules, policies and procedures to carry out core work and to maintain efficiency. One

of the shortfalls of the professional organization is 'the lack of control that senior

114

executives can exercise, because authority and power are spread down through the

hierarchy.’ This can make change within these organizations difﬁcult to achieve.

The Divisional Organization

This organizational type typically has many different 'product lines and business
units.’ A central unit provides support for and coordinates the work ofa number of
'autonomous divisions' that provide their own managerial oversight. Large and
mature organizations such as General Motors or Nabisco Foods are examples of
divisional organizations in that they offer a variety of brands or serVices, produce a
wide range ofproducts, and/or operate in a variety of geographic regions. Divisional
organizations encourage mangers to maintain more control and accountability than
in a machine structure. This may allow managers time to focus on big picture
strategic issues. One downside to the divisional structure is that it may encourage

competition among the divisions for limited resources from the central unit.

The Innovative Organization

The innovative organization, sometimes called the 'adhocracy,’ is found in new
industries and within companies that need to innovate and function on an 'ad hoc'
basis to survive. Filmmaking studios, which rely on the perpetual injection of new
ideas and concepts into the product line, typically fall into this category. In the
innovative organization, many decisions are decentralized and power and control is
delegated on an ad hoc basis. Workers move from team to team as projects are

created, completed, and as new projects are defined. In this sense, adhocracies are

115

extremely adaptable and can respond very quickly to market demands. But
innovation comes at a price. For example, conﬂict can arise 'when authority and
power are ambiguous' and working within an extremely ﬂuid environment where

change is constant, can be stressful for some employees. 6

Libraries as Professional Organizations

The professional serVice organization model could be considered as the type of
organization that most closely resembles those found in this study. Maister (2 009)
characterizes professional serVice organizations as not unlike medieval craftsman's
shops in which 'apprentices (junior managers or new hires), 'journeymen' (mid-
level managers or experienced professionals), and 'master craftsmen' (senior
partners or upper management) work in a tiered reward-driven fashion to deliver
knowledge services. "The professional serVice organization must focus on creative
ways to keep staff motivation and morale high, and they should develop strategies
to attract — and keep — the best and brightest professionals. Without talented human

capital, firms are not likely to survive in this competitive field." (Maister, p. 11).

While traditionally, libraries have most closely resembled professional
organizations, the changing demographics of librarians, staff, users, and a multitude
of external factors impacting libraries, require that libraries continually evaluate
organizational design and function to assure that clients' needs are being met. The

considerable emphasis that respondents in this study placed on organizational

116

issues reﬂects concerns on these issues. Evidence for this is found below in the
ranked ordering of topics of strategic concern that participants identified, which

shows organizational issues of paramount concern.

The ranked order of types of strategic issues (n=65) cited by TMT members (n=34)

drawn from Table 6 above, are as follows:

Organizational 15
Services 15
Collections 13
Space 11
Financial 8
Management 3

Total 65

Twenty three percent of strategic decisions (15 individual strategic decisions) cited
in this study were related to organizational issues. These issues ranged from
organizational changes taking place at the unit level, to task forces formed to look at
organizational issues, to library-wide consultant-led envisioning processes aimed at
identifying new ways to organize the library. The predominance of issues related to
organizational change may be an indicator that libraries are seeking new ways to be
more efﬁcient, better use the knowledge, skills and abilities of employees, and better

align with institutional priorities. Some eVidence that library organizations are

117

beginning to adapt to the forces of change can be found in the emergent
'hybridization' of professional titles assigned to TMT members, such as AUL for
Finance and Operations, AUL for Digital Initiatives and Collaborative Services, etc. It
may be that through the diversiﬁcation of duties assigned to TMT members through
'hybridization' that TMT members are gaining new crosscutting skills and

knowledge that will serve them well in an executive leadership capacity.

But there are other factors that may also be at play. For example, demographic
changes in libraries that are occurring through the retirement of long-tenure
employees and the recruitment of younger individuals whose values align perhaps
more closely with an 'adhocracy' or entrepreneurial type of organization — may also

be a factor driVing libraries to reevaluate the way they are organized.

Financial exigencies at the local, regional, national and international levels are often
drivers of change in organizations. The recent ﬁnancial downturn, which began in
2008 (characterized by several in this study as the 'global recession') and which
resulted in signiﬁcant budgetary cuts to both public and private institutions, was
cited on multiple occasions in this study as being causal in motivating strategic

decisions related to organizational rethinking.

The increasingly demanding expectations of users of libraries -- to have perpetual

access to everything immediately -- may well also be a factor that is motivating

libraries to restructure serVices to provide rapid delivery of content to users.

118

Traditional models of serVice in which patrons seek help and assistance from
librarians and library staff is rapidly being replaced by models of serVice that reach
out into communities of users, and whenever possible, anticipate services needs of
faculty and students. An example of the movement for librarians and libraries to be
more directly in the ﬂow of teaching and learning can be found in the embedded
librarian model in which a librarian actually relocates to an academic department so

as to be more adjacent to student learning and to faculty research and teaching.

Additionally, many of the services traditionally associated with libraries are being
outsourced, and these serVices need to be carefully managed within organizations.
Consortial inter-library lending, off-site book storage and retrieval, cloud-based
digital content storage and management systems, for example, each require
particular types of managerial oversight that libraries must cultivate. The
assessment of traditional services and the implementation and management of new
services as the findings of this research shows are of strategic concern to top
managers. Finally, new opportunities for libraries to align with faculty in support of
teaching and research may be yet another factor that is inﬂuencing libraries'
strategic thinking about how they might organize to better deploy services,

collections and expertise.

As of this writing, concerns about how best to build the 21St century academic

/research library collection are unfolding at rapid pace. While libraries will continue

to balance monograph and serial investments, and curate digital resources to meet

119

teaching and research needs, new forces are at work that will change the way
collections are thought about and constructed. A report 7 by the Association of
Research Libraries Task Force of the Steering Committee on Transforming Research
Libraries (2012) observes:
"Twentieth-century research library collections were defined by local
holdings, hailed as distinctive and vast. Twenty-first century research library
collections demand multiple strategies for ensuring broad access...In a
networked world, local collections as ends in themselves make learning
fragmentary and incomplete. Twenty ﬁrst century collection management
will therefore require increased collaboration within and among institutions,
as well as a shift from thinking of collections as products to understanding
collections as components of the academy's knowledge resources." (p.2)
As more and more emphasis in today's libraries is being placed on connecting
resources -- often held in disparate locations around the globe -- to researchers and
students, new ways to develop seamless methods for doing this important work are
being developed. Much of this work is made possible by the convergence of
networks that provide students and scholars with access to knowledge resources.
Changes in the ways in which we describe information objects, through for example
link-data protocols, offer new pathways for discovery. The findings from this study

indicate that a considerable degree of concern is being devoted to thinking about

these issues.

Since the mid 1990s, growing emphasis has been placed on the 'library as place'

where students "seek out intellectual interaction, informational exchange, and

socializing in an academic environment..." (Leighton and Weber, Planning Academic
and Research Library Buildings p.3) The emergence of the information commons
where technology abounds, space for group work is available, and digital tools and
content are readily available through stable, fast technology has found firm footing
in many libraries, including several in this study. These spaces are where students
can conduct serious work, be with friends, research and write papers, enjoy
beverages and food, make a Video presentation for class, do research in databases
and electronic journals, prepare for a class group project or presentation, surf the
web, use social media, attend talks, and learn about digital tools that can assist them
in their academic work (Seal, 2014). As libraries scale these spaces to meet the
evolving needs of students, new issues emerge. A group of concerns centers around
providing continued access to technology (hand held cameras, tablets, latest
hardware and software) and access to the furniture and ﬁttings (movable tables and
chairs, writable surfaces, study rooms) conducive to group work. The libraries in
this study showed, through identiﬁcation of space as a key strategic issue, that they
were indeed concerned with creating and scaling information commons and
learning commons to meet students' needs. These concerns intersected with
collections concerns, in particular, the challenges of 'right sizing’ collections to meet
learning and research needs in conjunction with the creation of high impact learning

spaces.

121

Moving toward Adhocracy?

While it is commonly stated that libraries are slow to change, findings from this
study suggest that there are certain changes occurring within top management
teams that indicate a cultural shift --toward a more autonomous and dynamic
organizational model--is taking place. The first indicator of this is the emergence of
trust as a guiding principle operative within the TMT. In several of the libraries
studied it was mentioned by TMT members that the top management team meets
occasionally without the CEO present. The ability for TMT members to meet as a
group without the CEO suggest that the CEO trusts the group to some extent to work
well together and is willing to give the group the power to do so without fear of the
top team disintegrating to a band of 'autonomous barons.’ Along with increased
autonomy come increased performance expectations (deliverables), that TMT
members described carrying out. This was well-stated by one TMT member from a
private institution who noted, "I was responsible both administratively and
curatorially to champion the interpretation of content areas, and to line up portions

of the collections with academic interests."

Another indicator that organizations are interested in creating an institutional
capacity to address the changing role of the library in the academic setting has to do
with the emphasis those libraries in this study place on face-to-face meetings on
strategic issues. Libraries as complex organizations are by nature deliberative. To
acquire the capacity necessary to deal with both known and unknown changes that

are impacting libraries, top management teams meet on a regular basis. It may well

122

be that these regular face-to-face meetings contribute to managers being exposed to
and involved in deliberations of a strategic nature. To the value of communication
between and among managers that can only result through persistent
communication, Mintzberg (1990) writes,
"In practice, management has to be two-faced—there has to be a balance
between the cerebral and the insightful. So, for example, I realized originally
that managerial communication was largely oral and that the advent of the
computer had not changed anything fundamental in the executive suite—a
conclusion I continue to hold. (The greatest threat the personal computer
poses is that managers will take it seriously and come to believe that they can
manage by remaining in their ofﬁces and looking at displays of digital
characters.) But I also thought that the dilemma of delegating could be dealt
with by periodic debriefings— disseminating words. Now, however, I believe
that managers need more ways to convey the images and impressions they
carry inside of them. This explains the renewed interest in strategic Vision, in
culture, and in the roles of intuition and insight in management."

This study found that top management teams value face-to-face meetings and meet

frequently and often for extended periods of time.

A final aspect of organizational rethinking/remaking was found in the comments by
several TMT members who observed that 'there are many cultures within the
library' (e.g., special collections, cataloging, etc.) and each brings its own
perspectives to bear on the work and on management, and on organizational
performance. In a professional serVice type organization, these cultural
differentiations can help inform strategic work. Several TMT members reported
ways in which their library was exploring new avenues to better share and
understand these cultural differences, by creating settings that brought staff

together outside the workplace, including activities (i.e., sports teams, outings, etc.)

123

that offered opportunities for informal socialization to build 'social capital' within
the library. These efforts are examples of ways libraries can help build a culture of
trust 8, autonomy, and accountability which can encourage managers to remain
engaged and committed to organizational goals and priorities even in times of
change and uncertainty.

Strategic Decision Making
Robert Birnbaum, professor of higher education at the University of Maryland,
College Park and a former higher education administrator, writes, "the idea of
higher education as a social institution has been displaced by higher education as an
industry" (2 000, p. 226). In this he is referring to the adoption by universities of
what he terms 'corporate fads' embraced to help universities perform better, more
efficiently. Birnbaum notes the following corporate fads that have been adopted by

universities in the interest of increasing efficiency, production and ROI:

Planning Programming Budgeting System (PPBS) 1960 — 1974

Management by Objectives (MBO) 1965 — 1980

 

8 Fulmer & Gelfand in a comprehensive review of the literature on trust offer this definition of the
two key aspects of trust operative in organizations. " We define trust in an interpersonal referent at
the individual level as a psychological state comprising willingness to accept vulnerability based on
positive expectations ofa specific other or others, trust in an interpersonal referent at the team level
as a shared psychological state among team members comprising willingness to accept vulnerability
based on positive expectations of a specific other or others, and trust in an interpersonal referent at
the organizational level as a shared psychological state among organizational members comprising
willingness to accept vulnerability based on positive expectations ofa specific other or others.
Likewise, trust in an organization at the individual level is defined as a psychological state
comprising willingness to accept vulnerability based on positive expectations of an organization, and
trust in an organization at the team level as a shared psychological state among team members
comprising willingness to accept vulnerability based on positive expectations of an organization, and
trust in an organization at the organizational level as a shared psychological state among
organizational members comprising willingness to accept vulnerability based on positive
expectations of an organization." (Fulmer & Gelfand 2012, 1174)

124

Zero — Base Budgeting (ZBB) 1970 — 1985
Strategic Planning 1972 — 1994
Benchmarking 1979 —

Total Quality Management (TQM) 1985 — 1996

Business Process Reengineering (BPR) 1990 — 1996

One of the challenges of adopting business models to higher education, Birnbaum
contends, is that businesses and government organizations are fundamentally
different. For-profit businesses and government agencies "are bureaucratized,
formalized, hierarchical, and tightly coupled... In contrast, colleges and universities
are professional organizations — are loosely coupled systems in which managers
with limited authority provide support for relatively autonomous specialists" (p.
150). Thus, in business, effective control can be maintained by detailed rules and
clear contingencies, whereas in academe many important behaviors are governed

by informal, sometimes-tacit rules, and contingencies are often not clear.

Yet, the adoption of practices borrowed from business can benefit academic
institutions, including libraries. For example, "the introduction of these practices
can often change long-established institutional structures and processes in positive
ways. A 'fad' may supplement or replace existing channels of communication; it may
create new groupings of people who otherwise might have never interacted."

(Lamal p.68)

125

Offering a slightly different but perhaps equally critical View on the inclination of
university administrations to apply business principles to the academic project,
Smith (2 000) ﬁnds, "that market principles continue to be misapplied to American
higher education, causing an undermining of the educational process. He argues that
criticism of higher education's traditional way of doing business as constituting
fiscal and personnel mismanagement is wrongheaded." He further notes that,
"almost all of the remedial measures taken to correct these assumed inefﬁciencies
have proven counterproductive." Instead, he contends, "we must attend to the
central problem confronting American higher education, which is "trying to do too
much with too little...we need to determine what we are willing to pay and how
these costs are to be allocated" (Smith, 2000, p. 133). According to Smith, real
economic efficiencies require building on traditional academic management and
governance structures, which have proven to be highly market sensitive. Smith

(2 000) says that the unspoken assumption underlying many criticisms about higher
education is that it is overpriced and that any businessperson could run it much
more efﬁciently and economically. But, says Smith, "They couldn't and wouldn't
because most academic institutions have historically been run in a highly efﬁcient, if
organizationally unorthodox manner" (2 000, p.3). That unorthodox manner
underscores the differences between business and higher education. Unlike
businesses, colleges and universities do not have owners and their goal is not to
maximize profits. All of their "customers" are subsidized and the "product" is sold at
less than the cost to produce it. Thus, in contrast to businesses, colleges and

universities have multiple and conﬂicting goals and intangible outcomes.

126

Strategic Planning in Libraries
In spite of these criticisms, it is rare these days to encounter a university — or a
university library - that does not have a strategic plan. Indeed, participants from five
of the six libraries in this study reported that their libraries either had or were
working on strategic plans. The strategic issues identiﬁed by participants in this
study, while not always explicitly aligned with formal strategic planning objectives,

seemed to fall into two distinct groups.

The first group is characterized by actions, projects, and decisions affecting
operational management of departments and units within the organization. This set
ofissues looks down into an organization and is focused on refining or improving
line management efﬁciency. The issues identified by participants in this group (e.g.,
collection weeding, creation of a mangers 'plus' committee, etc.) also reﬂect the
strategic emphasis that TMT members place on interfacing with middle managers
(MM) (Raes, et. al., 2011) and the importance of maintaining those interfaces for
optimal organizational performance. Raes notes, "We conceptualize the interface of
the TMT and MMs as a place where the separate worlds of the TMT and MMs
intersect, characterized by an alternation of episodes of contact, during which
interaction or "interface processes" take place, and periods of no contact, during
which TMT and MMs act on their own on the basis of assumptions, expectations, and
roles. A critical postulate in the interface model is that what happens during the
episodes of contact inﬂuences what happens in the periods without contact." (Raes,

2011, p. 103) Individuals who cited inward looking issues frequently stated as their

127

strengths their knowledge of the inner workings of the organization. As one recently
minted TMT member noted, "My strength is that I have done each of the jobs held by
people who report to me." The technical knowledge that comes from this type of
experience can be tremendously useful in acquiring a broad View of an
organization's technical capacity, knowledge that can help a TMT assess the risks
and rewards associated with a strategic decision. An open question is whether a
TMT member who possesses formative experiences grounded so completely within
the production side of the library can make the mental leap necessary to see the

'forest from the trees.’

The second group is composed of strategic decisions best characterized as being
rather more outward looking, in particular those issues and decisions that may have
a sustained impact on library services, the way the library is perceived within the
community, its political position, economic stability, and alignment with
institutional goals and priorities. Strategic issues that fall into this group include
development of a data management program, creation of a learning commons,
implementation of a new ILS system, allocation of special funding and closing an

iconic library.

Strategic plans are often closely tied-- in theory if not in practice -- to assessment of
library programs and projects. These assessments provide frameworks for
collecting data to evaluate progress toward stated goals and objectives. Increasingly

the product within university, academic and indeed library strategic plans is

128

learning outcomes, a concept promoted by regional and national accrediting bodies.
The push for universities to provide direct and indirect eVidence of student learning
has permeated the academic project and it has found its way into the narrative of
libraries. Within this study for example, both CEOs and TMT members queried on
how they measure success, spent considerable time articulating their library's need
to develop better metrics on assessing the impact that library services and
resources were having on student achievement. The emergence of assessment
programs in libraries and the proliferation of assessment librarians being recruited
to manage this aspect of library work is indicative of libraries' turn toward data-
driven management that draws on evidence surrounding the impact that space,
collections, services, librarians and staff interactions are having on students and
faculty. These efforts may well identify new ways for libraries to measure success in

the period ahead.

Emergent library strategies also seek to explore how libraries can extend their
services beyond those traditionally offered in past. For example, one private library
exempliﬁed this approach through several new programs it was creating to serve
faculty. One of these was the creation of a data curation serVice. The other was
building out the library's conservation program in ways that aligned it with
scholarly interests, activities and research in the material sciences. These
enhancements to existing programs and indeed the creation of entirely new
programs based on or drawn from library programs and projects may well signal

one way in which libraries are positioning themselves to be better organizationally

129

and functionally aligned with academic programs on campus and with the needs of

the broader scholarly community.

Another area that presents opportunities for libraries is in development of a
comprehensive curatorial strategy that spans print and digital resources. In this
approach, which is in nascent stages in some of the libraries in this study,
organization takes place around activities that focus on the broad interpretation of
collections for research and teaching as opposed domain speciﬁc, format speciﬁc
foci. One example of this approach was found in a library that was taking a
leadership role at the national level to develop metadata schema to facilitate the use
of linked data to enhance access to scholarly resources and make apparent

connections between information objects managed by the library.

Within the context of the TMT, a balanced mix of individuals is needed who 'keep
the ﬂywheel turning' (Collins, 2001), and whose perspectives skew to issues that are
outward looking, and those who can conceive of ways to leverage, extend and
integrate existing services in new ways to add value to teaching and research. Each
CEO will assemble his /her TMT accordingly to harmonize with his /her leadership
schema and repertoire (Hambrick, 1991) and the prevailing needs of the library and

its strategic position within the university.

This is a complex undertaking. To understand how this balance is achieved while

CEOs involve their top managers in strategic work invites examination of several

130

indicators of involvement. These strategic alignment indicators include: 1) top team
heterogeneity and strategic issue co-citation, 2) satisfaction and inﬂuence, and 3)
time in tenure and promotion. It is essentially a composite of these indicators that
provides further eVidence of a culture of development of top managers in academic

libraries. A proposition in this regard is outlined below.

Strategic Alignment Indicator 1: TMT Member Heterogeneity

and Strategic Issue Co-Citation

A prevailing idea within the stream of literature that deals with TMT behavior is
that TMT composition, especially heterogeneity (or diversity of members'
attributes) inﬂuences 'proximal team processes' such as innovation and
proﬁtability. While there are divergent Views on the role of heterogeneity -- and
most recently the moderating role of forms of TMT structural interdependence on
TMT performance (Hambrick, Humphrey, Gupta, 2014) -- heterogeneity continues
to be a useful characteristic to consider when examining TMT behaviors as related
to organizational performance. The theory of TMT tenure heterogeneity states that
individuals who 'enter an organization at about the same time tend to develop
shared perspectives, ease of communication, and overall cohesion, and that
individuals tend to be skeptical or even dismissive of those with different tenures

(Ancona and Caldwell, 1992 ; Hambrick, Humphrey, Gupta, 2014).

To understand if there is a positive association between TMT time in tenure

heterogeneity and strategic issues cited in this study by two or more members of

131

the TMT the following table was constructed. In four of the six libraries studied
instances of co-citation by TMT members who shared times in tenure was noted.

The times in tenure and strategic issues co-cited by TMT members follow.

TABLE 18. TMT Member Time in Tenure and Strategic Issue Co-Citation

 

 

 

 

Organization Time in Tenure between TMT members Issue

a 1.5 /1.5 years Financial *

b. 6 / 8 years Organizational *
c. 1.5/4/4.5 years Financial *

d. 1/1 years Financial

 

While no positive association between time in tenure and heterogeneity was found
among co-citing TMT members and CEOs in the four institutions above in which co-
citation was noted, CEOs in three of these institutions also co-cited the issues co-
cited by TMT members. Those instances are indicated in the table above by an

asterisk.

Findings indicate a close ratio in time in tenure in years between TMT members
who cited the same issue or issues. This supports the supposition that TMT
members with same or similar tenures do in fact tend to 'develop shared
perspectives,’ which in this case results in shared perspectives on issues they would

characterize as strategically important. These shared perspectives, as the ﬁndings

132

 

indicate, may in some cases also align with CEO's Views on issues of strategic

importance.

Strategic Alignment Indicator 2: Satisfaction and Inﬂuence
TMT members were asked to rank the degree of inﬂuence they felt they had had on
each of the strategic decisions they spoke about when interviewed. For those issues
cited by both a TMT member and a CEO it provides an opportunity to compare
inﬂuence ratings self—assigned by the respondent — in other words the degree of
inﬂuence the TMT member felt he/she had on the outcome—with the CEO's
perception of that TMT member's degree ofinﬂuence on the strategic decision. The
working assumption here is that if the self—ranking and the CEO's ranking are wildly
divergent, that would suggest roles and responsibilities pertaining to the strategic
decision were not clarified or well communicated to the TMT member as part of the
deliberative process. By contrast, if both the TMT member and the CEO similarly
rank a TMT member's inﬂuence on the same strategic issue, that suggests that
aspects of the strategic issue were communicated, roles were clariﬁed, and

deliverables articulated, including the TMT member's role.

A delta of 3-4 points between a TMT member's self ranking on an issue and a CEO's
ranking of the TMT member on the same issue would suggest a misalignment
between the role the TMT perceived they played and the role the CEO perceived the
TMT member played. This would not support the notion that CEOs are engaging

TMT members in strategic decision-making to the extent that a TMT member

133

believes they are having inﬂuence on the outcome ofa decision. Conversely, if there
is agreement between the TMT member and the CEO on the inﬂuence rating from
both the CEO's perspective and the TMT member's perspective, then it suggests
alignment between that TMT member and the CEO on perceived inﬂuence, which
becomes evidence supporting the claim that TMT members are being engaged in
strategic decision making and perceptions of involvement —in this case inﬂuence—

are mutually acknowledged by both CEO and TMT member.

TMT members were asked to rate on a scale of 1-5 (1: not satisfied, 5=Very
satisfied) their level of satisfaction with the outcome of the two strategic decisions
they cited. A follow-up questionnaire sent to participants asked them to rate
themselves on a scale of 1-7 (1=no inﬂuence, 7=much inﬂuence) regarding the level
of inﬂuence they felt they had had on a particular decision. Nine (9) of the twelve
TMT members who co-cited issues in common with CEOs and who were hired or
promoted by their CEOs, provided ratings to the satisfaction and inﬂuence

questions. Their rankings appear directly below.

TABLE 19. Satisfaction & Inﬂuence Ratings for Co-Citing TMT Members (n=9)

Overall, TMT members rated themselves as being satisfied with strategic decision
outcomes and in all but two cases rated their inﬂuence as moderate or high.
Satisfaction with outcome and inﬂuence are two important factors that together are
indicative of engagement with an issue. High satisfaction indicates a favorable
outcome to the decision. A high inﬂuence indicator coupled with a high satisfaction
rating offers further evidence of TMT member involvement in strategic decision-

making.

It is of note that in each of the three public institutions studied, there was a TMT
member in each who cited the same issue (s) as the CEO, was promoted or hired by
that CEO, and ranked their degree of satisfaction and their perceived degree of
inﬂuence as high. In each of these cases the CEO independently ranked the TMT
member's inﬂuence as high as well. By contrast, only one out of three private
institutions in the study presented the same conditions. Of note is that the one
institution that did present the same findings, had three TMT members who cited
the same issue as the CEO, who were hired or promoted by that CEO and recorded
high levels of satisfaction with the outcome of the decision and their inﬂuence on

the decision. The CEO again conﬁrmed the TMT member's high level of inﬂuence.

135

 

More work is needed here (e.g., a larger sample) to understand the extent to which
congruent rankings of inﬂuence by TMT members and CEOs are useful variables to
consider when assessing TMT alignment with and involvement in strategic
decisions and the extent to which this involvement supports the central thesis of
this research that chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) in academic and research libraries
are involving their top management team (TMT) members in strategic issues that
affect organizational performance, and, that involvement, when present, is

preparing top managers to assume leadership positions as CEOs.

Strategic Alignment Indicator 3: Time in Tenure and Promotion
What is the role oftime in tenure as a predictor for promotion to the TMT? Is there a
culture of 'bringing along’ managers to assume leadership positions within the
TMT? One CEO commented that his philosophy of leadership was to develop line
managers to assume leadership positions in the TMT rather than going to the
marketplace to ﬁll these jobs. To examine whether this notion of 'promoting from
within' was supported by data gathered as part of this study, time in tenure before
promotion was examined. Some interesting findings emerge. For example, 54% of
TMT members (n=2 8), (excluding CEOs) were promoted into their positions by the
CEO (57% ofindiViduals promoted were women). The number ofyears in tenure
before promotion ranged from 5.7 to 21 years, the median being 11 years and the
mean 11.7 years across all of the intuitions studied. One message here for aspiring
managers hopeful of promotion to the leadership group is to budget the requisite

time necessary for this to take place while being mindful of the stage, or 'season'

136

(Hambrick, 1991) the CEO is in with regard to his/her time in tenure. Hambrick's
theory argues that there are, "discernable phases, or seasons, within an executive's
tenure in a position, and that these give rise to distinct patterns of executive

attention, behavior, and, ultimately organizational performance." (p. 720)

Assessing TMT Engagement Based Upon

Issues Cited, Promotion, Satisfaction and Inﬂuence
Looked at discretely, instances of issues cited by two or more TMT members, and
perhaps by the CEO, whether a TMT member was promoted into his/her position by
the current CEO, a TMT member's level of satisfaction with a decision outcome and a
TMT member's perceived inﬂuence on a decision, it is difﬁcult to assess the full
extent to which TMT members are being brought along to assume leadership roles.
If, however, one Views these aspects together, a composite form of eVidence
emerges that is compelling. The presence of such evidence reﬂects strong alignment
with executive decision-making which in turn is indicative of a TMT member's
awareness of, involvement in and alignment with a CEO's sense ofissues that rise to
the level of strategic. When this composite condition is present within a TMT it
suggests that an individual TMT member can critically distinguish between
operational and strategic issues. It also suggests that the individual has been
intentionally recruited or promoted for their skill, knowledge and/ or ability to
identify and address strategic issues. When this composite indicator is present it
further suggests a heightened degree of alignment with the CEOs Vision, one that

necessarily takes into consideration the long-term health of the organization and its

137

role within the university, both important frames of reference for an aspiring
executive to possess. Thus, when composite characteristics are present, the

following proposition is offered:

Proposition: TMT Composite Characteristics and Strategic Alignment
It is proposed that a TMT member who cites an issue also cited by the CEO to which
the outcome ofthe decision is rated by the participant as good or very good (3-5 on
the scale) and for which the member rated themselves at a moderate or high level of
inﬂuence (4-7) corroborated by the CEO, it is a strong indicator that that TMT
member is being exposed to strategic issues and given a substantive role within the

context of the TMT to address these issues.

Measuring Success: Library Performance Metrics
Libraries are in a transition period with regard to how they measure success. While
many of the TMT members in this study mentioned that they routinely spend
inordinately large amounts of time and effort collecting and compiling transaction
statistics, Virtually all participants quickly added that the numbers don't tell the
whole story, especially in an environment where the library is increasingly being
asked to show its worth in more nuanced ways. Worth and value are increasingly
being looked at as metrics measured in part by the extent to which libraries are
serving faculty research needs and advancing student learning. A more difﬁcult
metric that was cited with frequency is how the library shows how student success

is tied to students' use oflibrary resources and services. Given today's emphasis on

138

strategic planning in universities, it was interesting to note that only one private
library cited its close alignment with university strategic plans as a strategic
priority. Another absence in the slate of metrics libraries pointed to was an explicit
measure of how and the extent to which organizations are developing their rank and
file staff and librarians for the future. While participants referred to mentoring staff
and advising colleagues, no one cited the extent to which their workforce was being

developed as a metric of strategic importance.

There is considerable variance in the way that TMT members gauge success. Even
within individual TMTs there is not agreement, beyond counting things, of ways in
which success is measured. Among libraries in the study, public institutions seemed
to place the most emphasis on gathering statistics and paying attention to
comparative data from peer institutions. In looking at the strategic issues TMT
members cited, there does not appear to be a signiﬁcant relationship between the
type of issues cited and the ways in which TMT members and institutions measure
success. TMT members in both public and private institutions in this study tended
to cite the growing importance of looking for ways to take the pulse of those they

serve as a measure Of SUCCESS.

Mentoring
Mentoring is often positively associated with 'bringing along’ individuals to assume
leadership positions. It is also used to orient newly hired employees to technical and

procedural aspects of jobs. Mentoring can occur formally or informally. Mentoring

139

programs, such as those sponsored by ALA, ARL, ACRL and other professional
organizations are designed to provide aspiring professionals with guidance from
seasoned professions. Akin to professional coaching and in some ways to leadership
institutes designed to groom executives, mentoring within the library context
focuses on cultivation and development of an often broad range of skills. Mentoring
is examined in this study to understand the extent to which it is present and how
subjects View their mentoring experiences. The presence of a 'mentoring culture'
may be helpful in understanding the extent to which the notion of 'bringing along’
TMT members occurs within libraries. The presence of a mentoring culture may, for
example, predispose CEOs to provide TMT members with opportunities to apply
their knowledge, skill and ability on issues of strategic importance. These
opportunities, like all executive delegations, come with risks that a CEO — and
indeed the entire TMT—must accept as part of doing business. These are the risks

associated with being a dynamic, learning organization.

Each of the CEOs in public institutions reported they had had mentors at some point
in their careers. One respondent noted of his mentor experience, "it wasn't a formal
mentoring relationship... she simply modeled what a library could become when it
reached beyond itself to others within the university community, and that got my
attention." Another CEO noted that he followed around an outgoing university
librarian and through this relationship mentoring occurred. Another CEO cited a

CEO with whom she had worked at another institution as her mentor.

140

Other TMT members characterized their mentoring experiences as either informal
and diffuse, or, formal and focused. One respondent noted that her mentorship
relationship with a CEO in a former position wasn't particularly well deﬁned: "1 just
learned a lot watching her." Another TMT member remarked that she had had a
group of mentors who over the years have collectively guided her along in her
career and was hard pressed to name but one. One TMT member noted, "I have had
colleagues who I would call 'peer coaches' with whom I have had good
conversations." By contrast, one respondent cited a rather more formal mentoring
relationship with a former CEO that resulted in the respondent being sponsored by

that person for an ARL leadership institute.

While a predominance of individuals citing the often inﬂuential roles that mentors
had played in their professional journeys was noted in this study, it is not clear the
extent to which these mentoring experiences are playing a role in CEO and TMT
members' decision making processes, or if these experiences incline TMT members
to mentor others or indeed expect themselves to be mentored. More research in
needed to explore the dynamics of mentoring and its effect on decision-making and
leadership development in the TMT. Findings from this study indicate that
mentoring is a variable to be more closely examined. Evidence for this was found in
a comment by one CEO who reﬂected on the important role that his mentor had
played on shaping his sense ofthe importance oflooking for ways for the library to

'reach beyond itself to the broader academic community. The respondent also cited

141

this individual with having a strong inﬂuence on his administrative skills such as
fund raising.

Identity
It was hard for some TMT members to step outside of their former identities as line
managers or supervisors when asked to identify strategic decisions that the library
has faced or will face in the future. Citing issues of strategic importance was perhaps
most challenging for TMT members whose identities, as librarians, were associated
with long tenures in a particular domain of library work, such as special collections.
These individuals were challenged to cite examples of decisions that have affected
the library enterprise as a whole. By contrast, individuals who had rather more
expansive View of strategic issues tended also to take a broad View of technology
and its current and future impact on the library and its publics. These individuals --
who tended to oversee either information technology or technical services -- on the
whole possessed a rather more broad View of the library as an information
/knowledge agent. They were also able to articulate, for example, some of the innate
limits to the architectures that underpin current information discovery,
preservation and access information structures that are in common use today, and
comment on how these systems may not scale in the future, especially as
information objects multiply exponentially and user demands and expectations for

access to these object similarly mature.

CEOs in public institutions (n=3) each characterized themselves as administrators.

CEOs in private institutions (n=3) tended to think of themselves in rather more

142

expansive ways (e.g., leadership and relationships, articulating a Vision; strategic

problem solver, coach; Connector — putting the right people together).

Thirteen non-CEO TMT members out of 28 (46%) ofTMT members who had been
hired or promoted by their CEO cited at least one ofthe same strategic issues as
cited by CEOs in their institutions. Eight of these individuals (62%) described
themselves as "administrators." The other five individuals in this group described
themselves around the portfolios they manage (e.g., technical services, IT, etc.).
Several of those who self—identified as administrators did so with a certain proviso.
For example, one TMT member noted, " I call myself a librarian, but I am more an
administrator." One newly minted TMT member noted, "I am feeling the growing
pains of moving from a functional area to a rather more pan-disciplinary, pan-
departmental administrative position. Balancing metadata concerns with people
sleeping in the library can be a challenge." Another respondent noted, ""Before I was
a TMT member I used to be suspicious of administrators, but now I've become one.
To my surprise, I ﬁnd there is a real satisfaction in being involved in the bigger
conversations and seeing how the results pan out." Finally one TMT member
characterized his role as, " being a bridge between many areas, providing back up
for the CEO." The variability of responses suggests that as library managers move
into TMT positions they experience a kind of identity shift from rather more
programmatic concerns associated with functional areas, to thinking broadly about
issues that affect the health and welfare of the institution as a whole. The data from

this study supports the notion that those hired or promoted into their positions as

143

TMT members and who have identified one or more issues of strategic importance
that match the CEOs tend to think of themselves as administrators. A question for
future research is the extent to which TMT members are able to maintain a balance
between overseeing the functional areas contained within their portfolios, and

keeping an ear to the ground for strategic issues that may be on the CEO's radar.

The Utility of the TMT
TMTs serve various purposes for CEOs. They provide a sounding board for executive
decisions the CEO is making, they serve as knowledge experts for those functional
areas they manage and they can help an executive assess the organizational impact
of a strategic decision. This knowledge is invaluable to the CEO. CEOs continually
fine-tune their TMTs with individuals who possess knowledge, skills and abilities
(KSAs) that align with the strategic Vision of the organization, which is frequently
set by the CEO. The top executive will bring individuals into the TMT who may not
have years of tenure in a particular area, but who have the potential for being
developed and who possess knowledge that can be used by a CEO to advance the
library's programs, its utility, and its stature within the university. As these
individuals participate in the complex work of the TMT and are exposed to executive
decision making and the 'frames' that an executive uses in that process (Bolman and
Deal, 1991, 2014) their perspective of and orientation to their work gradually shifts
from their previous function-based concerns (e.g., cataloging, public services, etc.),
to more broad-based administrative concerns. To the shift in identity that occurs

when TMT members are involved in strategic issues, one respondent noted, "I call

144

myself a librarian, but I do more administration." This person cited a rather large
strategic issue that impacted the library on a variety of levels, financial, symbolic,
and operational, etc. and her role as project manager. A TMT member's weaning
from -- as one respondent characterized it -- the 'fun' of domain-based library work
to administration was cited repeatedly as challenging. Indeed some individuals
make the transition more gracefully and effectively than others. Some never fully
succeed in making the shift from a domain -based View of the world to one that

concerns the good of the organization at large.

In one organization, a TMT member was recruited who possessed a background in
change management to come into the organization at a time when the library was
undertaking reorganization. This individual cited her skills working in organizations
of many types and sizes, and particularly with institutions other than libraries as
strengths she brought to the TMT at a time that the organization was undergoing a
change in culture, design and function. She Viewed her appointment to the library's

leadership team as strategic.

The CEO relies on the TMT for information that is critical to decision making. As one
CEO noted, "When you are a director, frankly that is what you do: you ﬁx things. It is
not about power and glory it is about ﬁxing things. That is partly team building,
partly picking a strategy, assessing the information available and making a
decision." Information is critical to the CEO being able to carry out this function and

the TMT serves a useful role in this regard. A similar observation came from a TMT

145

member who observed, "The Dean hears from all, but if there is not full consensus

he is prepared to make a ﬁnal decision, and that is great."

Thus, the TMT functions as a front line source of information that helps the CEO
make informed choices. The information TMT members offer regarding a specific
strategic issue is balanced by the innate experience and wisdom the CEO brings to
the job, his/her education, relationships, and other rationally-bounded factors that
are in many cases not explicit or knowable by others. (Lawrence, 1997). As one CEO
noted, "You never have enough information, sometimes you have to just learn to
trust your gut."

Dynamics Within the TMT
The working dynamics within top management teams in this study suggested a high
degree of emotional intelligence (E.I.) was at work; E]. is a characteristic identified
by Kreitz (2 009) as being an important attribute that future library executives
should possess. TMT members cited with frequency their ability to seek consensus
on issues brought before them by the CEO or others even when there was
disagreement. In examining innovation leadership, strategic ﬁt, and ﬁrm
performance, Carmelli, et. al, (2 010) observes, "when there are high quality
exchanges among members, this indicates there is harmony within the organization.
Strategic ﬁt is all about an organization that is in harmony with the external
environment. We suggest that there is an overlap between what is happening within
the organization and between the organization and its external environment." (341).

Co-citedness, or agreement on issues of strategic importance and agreement or

146

consensus on strategic decision outcomes may be indicative of the presence within

the leadership team of the high-quality exchanges Carmeli cites above.

Reﬂecting a slightly different aspect of TMT alignment, a top manager from a public
institution touched on the importance of being aware of the library's strategic
agenda but also managing the work within his portfolio, including obtaining the
resources to carry out projects. He observed, "we take an egalitarian approach [to
our interactions with each other], I don't want to step on toes but I have a clear
Vision of what I need to do." A TMT at another institution touched on the
interpersonal aspects of shared decision-making that occurs within the TMT noting,
"some decisions are easier than others, we each have very strong opinions." She
observed that, "in some cases there will be strong agreement on an issue and a
strategy for moving forward and then it will be met with resistance' which speaks to
one of the challenges associated with TMT and middle management interfaces. To
this challenge, one TMT member added, that even though there was considerable
'transparency' in a reorganization project, "some staff members were still left

grumbling and unsatisfied."

Team Building and Executive Discretion
Team building is a critically important aspect ofa CEO's job. Leaders of
organizations take great care in selecting individuals for TMT positions based on a
variety of factors that range from choosing individuals who can manage functional

areas well to those who can assist the CEO in managing particular aspects of the

147

library or its position within a busy and often competitive university environment.
Still there are those who are recruited because of their familiarity with the
university or their knowledge and experience in the private sector. The CEO
exercises executive discretion in choosing a team that comprises the right mix of
lieutenants, captains and adVisors who can provide the right balance between
maintaining business continuity and introducing innovation. A CEO's criteria for
selection of TMT members can be both transparent and opaque. The demographic
distribution of TMT members, their time in tenure, and promotion from within
reﬂects ways in which CEOs are attempting to strike a balance between TMT
members who run the day-to-day operations and those who bring KSAs that enable
the library to think differently--and often strategically--about the kinds of services it

might offer in the future.

The Effect of TMT Portfolio Changes
With the onset of the recession beginning in 2008 some libraries underwent budget
reductions that resulted in staff reductions, library departments being eliminated,
merged with others, and in some cases entirely new units being created. The effect
of this on top managers interviewed was noted. For example, when a TMT member
'inherits' a new unit or operation as a result of departmental consolidations, it
requires the manager to provide new and sometimes additional oversight of these
new portfolio assets. While additional or new oversight responsibilities may on the
one hand provide TMT members with an expanded knowledge of valuable library

operations and programs, the added responsibility may also limit the time a TMT

148

member has to work closely with the CEO on projects of strategic importance,
projects that would help the TMT member develop the experience and knowledge

needed to move into executive leadership circles.

CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSION

Introduction
This chapter opens with some general observations on the 21St century library
environment, followed by a reView of evidence to support the central thesis of this
research, that top managers are being 'brought along’ to assume executive level
positions through on-the-job involvement with strategic decision-making. A
discussion of new questions that this study raises follows as does mention of some
of the limits of the study. Last, suggestions for future work are covered that extend

the inquiries in this study into new scholarly realms.

The 21St Century Library Landscape

Libraries are operating in times of rapid change: information as a commodity is
moving from the tangible to the intangible, from the physical to the Virtual, from
public to provisional. 'Business as usual' has been disrupted by the changing global
demographic characteristics, behaviors and expectations of an increasingly diverse,
consumer-savvy, networked, clientele. Libraries are running to keep up with these
dizzying changes and the organizations in this study reﬂected this sprint: Missions

and goals are being re-examined, strategic plans are being written, organizations

149

themselves are being deconstructed and re-enVisioned with the hope they will
contain the elements needed to adapt to societal changes and changes within the
academy (e.g., multi disciplinary research, new modes of teaching, ﬂipped learning
models, etc.). It is no easy task, and as the tensions from these realities were
discussed by top managers and CEOs I couldn't help to wonder how the
organizations in the study would know when they had gotten it right. Maybe
observations by several ofthe CEOs I spoke with sum it up: "We measure success
when we don't get complaints from faculty." Yet, I couldn't help sensing that behind
this answer was looming a much larger set of issues connected to how the library
deﬁnes itself in the future, how it preserves market share in the face of rising
competition, and how it expresses utility to critics both within the academy and
beyond who -- perhaps because libraries have not been especially good at
proclaiming in effective ways the wonderful services they bring to the academy --
cast an increasingly skeptical eye on libraries' value proposition. While answers to
the 'how do you measure success?’ question showed great variability -- that ranged
from counting things (transactions) to the use of alt-metrics that gauge how
scholars have benefitted from using resources subscribed to or provided by the
library -- there was very little agreement on strategic things libraries are doing to
move outside of comfort zones and to stretch to align with academic programs and
advance in scalable ways with big academic initiatives. Equally puzzling, given the
graying of the profession and the imminent retirement of a sizable cohort of top
executives, was the relative de-emphasis of leadership development as a specific

strategic priority. Given the whirlwind of change that surrounds libraries today,

150

there was a surprisingly little mention of innovation, specifically game changing
things libraries were doing to reach beyond themselves to align in significant ways
with academically impactful, politically advantageous, ﬁnancially rewarding high

level strategic agendas.

Evidence of Leadership Development

In spite of these conditions, the top managers in this study were able to clearly
articulate issues of strategic importance. And, there was progressive, and I believe
significant eVidence to support the claim that TMT members do agree on issues
considered strategic, that TMT members and CEOs on occasion also agree on these
issues, and through rankings of satisfaction, inﬂuence and promotion we can say
there exists within the TMT CEO nexus a favorable degree of alignment in strategic
Vision, which, is a strong indicator that TMT members are being progressively

'brought along' to assume leadership positions in academic research libraries.

Further evidence that supports a culture of bringing along top managers in the
libraries in this study is found in the overwhelmingly high number of CEOs and TMT
members who stated they had beneﬁtted from the wisdom and guidance of mentors.
A topic for future research is the extent to which these mentors have left an
indelible and lasting inﬂuence on CEOs (and TMT members in general for that
matter) such that they are inclined, even possibly predisposed to guide and groom
aspiring top managers for executive positions. An additional piece of evidence to

support the assertion that top managers are being brought along comes from the

151

ways in which TMT members describe their roles in the strategic decisions they
discussed 9 which are indicative of roles that one would expect to find in the

executive office.

As this study shows, the CEO blends the knowledge, skill and ability found within
the top management team with adVice provided by various 'consultants' from within
and outside the library to inform decision making and strategic direction. One could
argue that the lines are becoming increasingly blurred between the roles and
responsibilities of those who in past traditionally made up the TMT and those who
are increasingly being called into serVice on strategic issues libraries face. Indeed,
the increasing complexity of issues that come before the CEO requires that he /she
draw upon an expanding array of experts whose Views on legal (copyright), human
resources, financial/budgetary, and external issues provide a CEO with the
information needed to assess risks and calculate benefits associated with strategic
decisions. Indeed, this study found that CEOs consult with a broad range of actors
(TMT and non-TMT) when gathering the information they need to make a strategic

decision.

 

9 Some of the roles TMT members described playing that reﬂect a turn toward the executive office, include:

"represented the library ,- point person with academic affairs , responsible for closing a branch library",-
"served as a consultant for the TMT",- "was administratively and curatorially in charge",- "controlled the message
to the public." These roles and behaviors are aspects of what a CEO does. Their presence as characteristics

within the TMT suggests a culture of executive administration is being developed and cultivated.

152

Dispersed Expertise

The roles that consultants, infrastructure specialists (e.g., facilities managers, etc.)
and public affairs experts play will be increasingly important in future. Their
presence in several of the libraries studied suggests a desire for the library to
connect in meaningful and productive ways with both the broader infrastructure on
university campuses, and to individuals, organizations and publics in communities
outside the university proper. As one TMT member noted, "It is time for libraries to
stop naval gazing. Libraries need fresh, outside Views. The information world is
competitive. To compete requires a new way of thinking and a new business model.
It is not enough to claim that key role oflibraries lies in supporting teaching and
learning on campuses. These are becoming tired tropes." How will the TMT of the
future expand its collective knowledge, skill and expertise to reach beyond itself as

it builds capacity for the future?

New Questions

In answering the central question of whether CEOs are bringing along top managers
to assume executive leadership positions, new questions arise that inVite future
research. For example, if CEOs are in fact bringing along tomorrow’s executives, are
they bringing them along in ways that reﬂect the changing landscape of user
expectations, the disruptive effects of technology, or the types of organizations the

next generation of leaders will lead? To what extent are the Visions of today's CEOs

153

'bounded' (Hambrick, Mason, 1984) by repertoire and schema 10 drawn from 20th
century experiences and situations? What might be the effect of these forces on a
CEO's ability to set a Vision and agenda for the future? In other words, if CEOs can
only expose TMT members to management and leadership practices that they
themselves have lived, will these frames of reference — as wise as they may be —
have the same resonance, value and relevance for the next generation of library

leaders?

Additionally, an executive's 'time in tenure' and indeed a top management team's
time in tenure may both be factors that affect a top management team as it thinks
about the future. Research shows, "that a top team's tenure in an organization
affects (and serves as an approximation for) the team's commitment to the status
quo, its informational diversity, and its attitudes to risk." (Finkelstein, Hambrick,
1990, p.486). The argument is that 'team tenure is expected to affect organizational
outcomes.’ The theory further states that, "organizations that are led by long-
tenured CEOs and top managers will tend to have: 1) "persistent unchanging
strategies, 2) strategies that conform closely to averages, and 3) performance that
conforms to industry averages." (ibid., 486). Libraries thinking about planning for

the future may wish to take into consideration these variables.

 

10 A schema, according to Hambrick and Fukutomi, 1991 (and Kiesler & Sproul 1982; Lord & Foti,
1986) "is the preexisting knowledge system that a manager brings to an administrative situation. It
includes consciousness and unconscious preconceptions, beliefs, inferences and expectations."
(Hambrick & Fukutomi, 751). Repertoire refers to an executive’s 'supply of skills, devices, or
expedients’ used to address issues drawn from prior experiences. Together, "a CEO’s schema and
repertoire form his/her paradigm, or model of the environment, the organization, the CEO, and the
interconnections among these." (ibid, 722)

154

For CEOs whose tenures are extended, is there a moderating role that a TMT might
play to attenuate or limit the effects oflong tenure? In other words, even if a CEO is
challenged to take risks, seek out new sources of information and develop strategies
that don't conform to industry averages, can a TMT that contains a demographically
diverse membership moderate, counteract, or compensate for these characteristics
in ways that encourages that organization to take risks, experiment and perhaps
shape itself to be in close alignment with future academic programs and customer

expectations?

A related concern, surrounding the concept of 'bringing along’ aspiring managers to
assume executive positions, is that some TMT members may not aspire to become
CEOs. Indeed, several participants in this study expressed this sentiment. What
then? Ifa CEO has a sense of those within their TMT who aspire to become
executives, how does that knowledge affect work assignments, or the extent to

which those TMT members work with the CEO on strategic matters?

Finally, as long-tenured top management teams and particularly CEOs recruit
younger managers to diversify the TMT and bring fresh perspectives to the team
and to strategic thinking -- perhaps with the assumption that this diversity will be
more in alignment with the demographic characteristics of students -- there is no
guarantee that these individuals will in fact aspire to assume executive leadership
positions. As Lyons, et. al. (2 012) observe, "younger generations change jobs and

employers at a greater rate than previous generations and that they are more

155

willing to accept non-upward career moves." (p. 333) He bases this assertion on the
emergence of new career patterns that have replaced the traditional 'age and stage'
theory (Super, 1957) of career development, in which an individual moves through
an explorations stage, an establishment stage, a maintenance stage, and ﬁnally a
disengagement stage. Lyons asserts that, "broad environmental changes such as
globalization, technological advances, increased workforce diversity, the increased
prevalence of knowledge-based work and trends toward outsourcing and the use of
contingent workers have created conditions that have rendered traditional career
paths outmoded. " (p. 335) The emergence of ﬂatter organizations in which
traditional upward mobility is limited has meant there is less of an opportunity for
individuals to move up within a company. Lyons notes, "the psychological contract
has changed from one that is based on long—term employment to one that is based

on employability." (p. 335)

What do these new models of employability look like? Two metaphors emerging
from recent research used to describe ways in which the younger generation of
workers is seeking employment are the 'boundary less' career model (Sullivan and
Baruch, 2009) and the 'protean' career model. (Hall, 1976). The protean model
states that 'linear careers would give way to self—directed careers focused on
psychological satisfaction.’ Psychological satisfaction would be achieved by
individuals experiencing 'multiple iterative micro-cycles of exploration, trial,
establishment and mastery as the individual acquires new skills and competencies

across the life span." (p. 336). The boundary less career model (so named in that it is

156

in direct opposition to traditional bounded movement one follows up through a
hierarchy), "may reﬂect a variety of different meanings, including movement
between different employers, drawing career validation from outside one's
employing organization (as in the case of academics) reliance on resources external
to one's organization in order to do one's job, or focusing one's career goals toward

one's family life rather than organizational goals" (p. 340).

While research has not found that modern career types have replaced traditional
ones, it points to socio-cultural differences that institutions should be aware of that
are found within particular cohorts including Gen-Xers and Millennials (such as
their tendency to change jobs frequently early on in their careers, their tendency to
move into lateral positions that provide rewards (versus upward movement in an
organization), and the high value they place on work-life balance. These
generational characteristics may be important considerations for CEOs as they
conﬁgure top management teams to address strategic issues and as they do so with

an eye to developing team members to assume executive positions.

Finally, if CEOs are bringing along TMT members to assume positions ofleadership
in institutions, at what point does this work reach fruition? In other words, is there a
point in the grooming and bringing along process that a TMT member reaches the
point of readiness to take on the role ofa CEO? What are the signs that this point has
been reached? What does a CEO do in a case when a TMT member has 'hit the

ceiling' and needs to move up and out? What does a CEO do (and indeed a TMT

157

member do) when a TMT member has hit the ceiling and begins to operate as an
'autonomous baron' ? What indeed, does a CEO do when multiple members of the
TMT reach this point? These are clearly concerns that require study as we think
about developing top managers' skills, knowledge and ability to take on executive

leadership in tomorrow’s academic libraries.

Limits to the Study

There are several limits to the present study. While the data provided by the six
participating institutions and the 34 individual participants in those institutions is
richly informative, it would be useful to survey a larger number of institutions to
test the findings. A survey based on several key ﬁndings of this study could serve as
the basis for querying, for example, CEOs and top managers in ARL libraries, and/ or

in libraries in private college consortia.

The second limit to the study is that while some differences between public and
private libraries were observed (i.e., size of the top management teams, differences
distribution of strategic issues by type, etc.) these differences did not appear to be
significant regarding the extent to which top managers were being developed. A
larger data sample is needed to more fully understand if there are substantive
differences between public and private libraries on the issues examined in this
study. Lacking this, it is difﬁcult to draw broad conclusions about similarities and

differences between public and private organizations.

158

Future Work

The findings of this research suggest the need for future work in several areas. First,
while this study focused on the decision-making processes operative within the
coalition of top managers, it would be interesting to conduct a follow-up study that
probed how, if, and when CEOs turn to top managers for adVice versus relying on
their own innate leadership paradigms (schema and repertoire). In this line of
inquiry it would be interesting to know what specific attributes (KSAs) CEOs look
for in aspiring managers, and criteria CEOs use to rate progress ofa top manager in
his /her development. Related, it would be interesting to know what triggers CEOs to
turn from the TMT to external adVisors for counsel on strategic matters, and if this
turn is a normative behavior, and strategies the CEO uses to keep the top
management team informed, involved and engaged when working with external

actors.

Further work is also needed on how libraries measure success. This research found
that current measures of success vary considerably. It also found that there is a
great deal of interest in this topic. Indeed, some institutions in this study are
developing new ways of measuring impact, value and worth through the
development of alternate metrics that look beyond transaction counts. This work is
promising and suggests the need for a more in-depth study into this question in the

future.

159

Finally, as this research found considerable interest among top managers in re -
envisioning and reorganizing libraries to meet future challenges, it would be useful
to know what factors are driVing organizations to consider one type of organization
design over another, what the performance expectations might be of these new
designs, including the KSAs leaders in these organizations will need to possess to be

successful. Do they differ from the skills of today's managers?

As CEOs and their top managers continue to develop the administrative capacity to
address strategic issues on the horizon, it is quite likely that they will develop new
ways to measure the impact that their organizations are having on the university.
New ways of assessing impact will become important and will likely take into
consideration a wide range of activities, services, and interactions of library
personnel. These aspects will necessarily be closely tied to strategic goals and
initiatives. For this reason the cultivation of leaders is critically important. Astute,
skilled leaders will be needed to bring along programs and practices that have
proven to be essential in supporting teaching, research and learning on campuses.
But they must also be capable of thinking broadly and creatively about issues that
are strategically important for the library as it seeks to position itself to meet the
changing needs of those it serves and those with whom it collaborates. As this
research has shown, leadership development is a dynamic process, and it is taking
place within the top management teams in public and private institutions examined

in this study. Time will tell, however, if the skills and knowledge that top managers

160

are acquiring today will prepare them fully for the roles that they will be expected to

play in tomorrow’s knowledge economy.

APPENDIX 1.

Recitals, Consent to Participate, Interview Schedule, Questionnaire
Recital for Interviews with Library Directors

Thank you for meeting with me. Let me explain more fully the goals of the
study. I am interested in the decision-making role of people who form your top
management team and the process of strategic decision-making. Thus I need to
know who the team members are, how the team works together as a group, what
some of the major strategic decisions are that have been addressed over the past
two years, and the processes that emerged in making these decisions.

I will have some questions for you and for members of your top management
group. Most of these are open-ended.

Please note that at any time you may decide to withdraw from this study or
not answer the particular question.

I seek your support in interviewing members of your top management group.
These interviews will emphasize the strategic decision process. Is that agreeable to
you?

Once all the interviews for this library have been completed I will send a
questionnaire to each member of the top management team, including you. The
questionnaire will ask questions on the same issues that will emerge in this
interview. These data also will be confidential.

Data collected through all interviews, including this one, and through the
questionnaires, remain conﬁdential. All identities of institutions and people
participating in this study will be confidential. I am the only person who will see
these data.

Your consent to participate in this research is important. Let me address any
questions you may have and then seek your permission to proceed.

Recital for Interviews with Top Management Team Member

The University Librarian has identiﬁed you as a member of his/her top management
team. I have asked the University Librarian to inform the members of the library's
top management team about the study and to ask for the participation of each
member. Participation is entirely voluntary and the university librarian will not be

162

informed as to who on the top management team has agreed to participate or has
not agreed.

I am seeking your consent to participate in my research study on strategic decision
making in university libraries and the roles members of the top management team
play in that decision making process. No libraries will be identified in this study and
no person who participates in this study will be identiﬁed.

Consent to Participate in Research
Top Management Team Member

Pilot Study of Top Management Teams in Academic/Research Libraries

You are asked to participate in a research study conducted by Mark Roosa, PhD
candidate in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies (GSEIS) at
the University of California, Los Angeles. You were selected as a possible participant
in this study because have been identified as a member of the top management team
in the university library.

Why is this study being done?

This is a study of strategic decision making in university libraries and the roles
members of the top management team play in that decision making process.

What will happen if I take part in this research study?

If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you to answer
questions relating to decisions made in the library over the past several years, who
participated in the decisions, and how the need for the decisions came to the
attention of the library. The interview can take place in your ofﬁce or in another
agreed-upon location. Following all of the interviews undertaken in the library, the
investigator will send each respondent a short questionnaire about specific
decisions that emerged from the interviews.

How long will I be in the research study?
Participation in the study will take a total of about 2-3 hours over a period of several

weeks.

Are there any potential risks or discomforts that I can expect from this study?
There are no anticipated risks or discomforts.

Are there any potential beneﬁts if I participate?
You will not directly benefit from your participation in the research.

163

Will I receive any payment if I participate in this study?
You will receive no payment for your participation.

Will information about my participation and me be kept conﬁdential?

This is an organizational study and so data will be analyzed in order to get
organizational scores. No individual data will be reported; all individual data will be
and will remain conﬁdential. Only the RI. will have access to the data and the data
will be kept in his home office. Institutions will not be identified by name. They will
be disguised and described only in broad terms, for example: "a library serving a
major public research university."

Withdrawal of participation by the investigator.

The investigator may withdraw you from participating in this research if
circumstances arise which warrant doing so. If you leave the library you may have
to drop out, even if you would like to continue. The investigator will make the
decision and let you know ifit is not possible for you to continue.

APPENDIX 3.
Measuring Organizational Success
CEOs and TMT members - Complete Responses
Institution a.

1.CEO - Continue to use old inputs and outputs (transaction statistics); they are good
indicators, but loosing significance in terms of telling the story of how the library
has an inﬂuence on student success. (the direct implication here is that the success
of the library is closely tied to student success, not other drivers, such as having a
comprehensive collection of X, etc.) Others: qualitative data gathered from surveys
(LibQual and locally created surveys) increasing more useful; challenged to but
interested in gathering quantitative data around student success linked to library
use. Later will hope to carryout longitudinal studies that track student success over
time with regard to library.

2. Benchmarking, state university system data, comparison with peers, relational
data; acrl survey data; use software and off-the-shelf products to compile statistics;
data points tracked include staffing, hours, etc. professional level expectations are
benchmarked; leadership activities; even though not an ARL library, they track ARL
trends, statistics and current issues that reﬂect interest within the ARL community

3.Metrics need to be tied to local performance issues. How does a metric tie directly
to patrons; what is the local student population saying about the library. Metrics
vary by things that students are required to do in the library (IL instruction) versus
ways in which the library adds value to students' work by their choice.

Institution b.

1. (CEO): Physical use oflibrary is an important metric. If people are using the
library in various ways it is a 'sign of Vitality.' Metric: people voting with their feet.
Should students shun libraries and ﬂock to social clubs and unions would be a bad
thing.

2.Pay attention to ARL stats and library rankings. Commission report went into
assessment. One of the difficulties was that different metrics and rankings are used
by all of the libraries. No agreement. Faculty member in a dept. wants to know why
the library isn't number one. Peer comparisons with other state libraries.

3. Well we have the ARL statistics. Within the past decade faculty and others have
become aware of them. They haven't quite caught up with the digital world, but they
can be helpful. Gate counts, dollars spent are tracked at most UCB libraries and they
can be 'helpful'. "Don't know if we are really very good at knowing how we are
supporting student learning or helping faculty with their research." Were we to
develop metrics to track this that would be a significant new direction for us." We

182

have talked about hiring an assessment librarian. Have talked about this with other
TMT members; we would like to do this. New job descriptions have written into
them an assessment piece.

4. The re-enVisioning exercise we looked at other institutions. Faculty really want to
hang their hat on ARL data, but the library faculty are increasingly skeptical of
whether the ARL stats are useful metrics to assess how impactful libraries are in the
lives of students and faculty. 'No one wants to fall in rankings" but there are other
factors to consider. We look at the ARL stats because the faculty have adopted these
metrics, in fact we spend a good deal of time explaining to our faculty that the ARL
statistics don't tell the whole story, it is a more complex and nuanced picture than
what the rankings and pure numbers show. We want to ask a lot of other things for
example, for those who spend time in the library, how does that affect academic
performance. How are we doing? How are we contributing, these are the key
questions we should be asking. Counting things simply doesn't tell the story.
Institutes count things in different ways.

c.
1. (CEO): We have and currently make great use ofARL stats, and a subset ofARL
institutions that our university uses for comparison. During budget crisis we looked
at how many library dollars per student were being made available. Looking at
longitudinal comparisons regarding percentages spent on say collections or staff;
keep track of all transactions. Digital metrics (from vendors) tweets, retweets, TV
channel (program downloads) newsletter, downloads of articles.

2. Compares materials budgets with other peer institutions; ARL staffing metrics
were consulted during redesign process to understand what was a reasonable
staffing level. Also looked at materials and staffing was especially important as we
looked at reducing collection size. Size is important to support certain disciplines.

3. In past pretty mundane. Now we look closely at how much we are spending
(within the state system and across US) depending what we are looking at on
collections and staff. We look at ARL stats. And we invest a lot in compiling these
numbers, but more and more we are looking at other metrics, usage of facilities,
services, resources. We've collected for years these data that show Visitors,
transactions. Now we are looking at what that means in terms of the impact we are
having, the integration of the library into the university. We are probably the norm,
would like to come up with better ways to gauge success. Our decentralized campus
makes it challenging to align with student outcomes, but we are moving in that
direction.

4. Re org. has invited us to look at other institutions that have reorganized like us.
ACRL collections and stafﬁng. We have also relied on other libraries in our
consortium for collections (we borrow), we look at ILL, and our buying power to fill
in gaps. Now we count stuff: how do we compare what we did in the past to what we
are doing now: are serVices different? Digging into numbers in new ways.

183

Private Institutions

d.

1. The library is currently in the process of coming up with a new way of doing this;
a new framework. There is a lot of dissatisfaction with the current way of counting
things. One component of the new way will be to better know how [the library's)
resources are specifically being used by scholars.

2. [A private foundation] has given the library funding to look at some new ways of
documenting the value that libraries add to the university and to academic life. We
collect statistics but we probably don't deploy them very much.

3.0ur work is changing and much of what we do is not reﬂected in any statistics. For
example in my work we are asked to do mapping from one metadata standard to
another that produces a huge intellectual output but no numbers that can be easily
counted and compared with other institutions. Hard to tally these things.

4. (CEO) ARL stats are interesting but not definitive. Are working with [a private
foundation] to develop new benchmark and assessment method and strategy. This
is very interesting to provost and president. How do we measure success: we
measure success by the lack of complaints. Always changing the mix of services,
being innovative, addressing student and faculty needs. I have not had within 26
years major complaints; uprisings, etc. do this by anticipating needs, high level of
interactions with faculty and dept. chairs, comms. On library, testing solutions
before deploying them. Respond quickly when we do get complaints. "There isn't
strategic planning at [our university], it is opportunistic."

5. Metrics: CEO is working on this. We don't have good metrics and rely too much
on anecdotal information.

6. Metrics: I pay attention to how many items are paged per year. If you have 8-
9000 items a year that is impressive. Plus the anecdotal feedback. Another variable
for success is seeing the (high) volume of scholarship that is taking place with our
collections by scholars outside of our institution." This speaks to our global reach.
For example, 75% of our users are not from our institution. Online access to
collections through finding aids is increasing this trend. Other measure of success is
the increasing number of classes being taught in special collections. Another metric
is the number of dissertations produced by researchers using the collections.

7. Metrics — been engaged in a benchmarking project to look at new ways to assess
our success. "We've long since gotten away from gate counts and volume counts as a
way of gauging success." Instead, we try to look at the level of innovative work we
have done with patrons, and we try to measure our success from the feedback we
are receiving from our users." We have talked about doing an annual survey; the

184

committee on libraries (faculty and a few students) has been a helpful sounding
board; we try to look back on projects where we assess from hindsight our key
successes. "having a positive impact on users, being innovative and forward
thinking,...the library of the future, not the past."

8. Metrics: CEO is working on a new way of measuring success. Council on Asian
Libraries. East Asia Association also collects statistics each year. Transaction
records, etc. There is some competition. Still competing with our peers using the old
fashion metrics. The public is still asking for these data. Some faculty too. Who is the
best? The satisfaction of the students and faculty is however the top goal. How do
you measure that? Feedback from liaison librarians, faculty, etc. (Anecdotal). How
many new faculty and staff are added to the library for E. Asian studies.

9. Metrics: We are in the process of looking at benchmark data. The ARL stats don't
reﬂect how we are impacting teaching and learning. How do we measure
leadership? How to we track citations of scholars using your collections. "we don't
take the data at face value—we ask more questions about it." We look at indicators
that support our primary goal as being a resource for our community." (both
qualitative and quantitative) We look at the Ivy+ for transactions. We are not too big
on comparative data.

e.
1. Metrics: ARL stats, web analytics, one of the new work groups is an assessment
group, haven't been too involved in this yet.

2. Metrics: In public serVices we hired an assessment librarian to look closely at
quantitative data. We established a library ombudsperson. In that group we tend to
pull that info together and it goes to TMT for reView. This assessment helps assess
student learning. Assessment person is organized under "user experience" group,
which is located under public services.

3. Metrics: have used dollars per student. This year they said 'stop telling us that.’
We look at ARL investment index. We are at the bottom. Both are artificial. What
matters most is whether the students are satisfied and faculty members are getting
what they need. "The university as a whole does not value the library anywhere to
the extent that our peers do."

4. Metrics: Hoping in our new org structure to build in cross cutting way to
measure effectiveness. We have looked at various data points — mostly to support
budget requests. This year budget told library to eliminate old metrics (e.g., level of
support per student, etc.). Comparison with peer organization libraries also not too
helpful. Count and compare transactions. None of us are very happy with those
measures, but that is what we have.

185

5. (CEO) 'Happy faculty.’ I measure success by how well we are received at annual
budget meetings. Measurements of success are sometimes tangible, sometimes not. I
can look at funds raised, or some other things, but these are not always telling. A
political success is sometimes the best success, how we are perceived, who was
pleased. If the general level of complaints is low that is an indicator we are doing
things right, satisfying our users. The opinion of the provost counts as well,
especially when he shares positive Views about the library publically and with
colleagues. Success sometimes occurs when budget increases come automatically
after years of arguments. [n.b. this library has not had an increase in operations in 5
years].

6. Nothing systematic. "Sudden and arbitrary" peer institution lists are ﬂawed as no
two institutions are really very much alike. Even within the CIC we are outliers
because most members are large state institutions and we are a small private
institution.

f:

1. Metrics: Have a formal process with very speciﬁc goals that initiatives campus
wide support. The library has adopted numerous goals. Don't care about ARL
statistics. We are what we are and really don't compare ourselves to others, except
to get [our university] into the top 10. No one has ever asked us where we stand in
the ARL rankings. We may change that now we are part of [a consortium of colleges
and universities] We only have 20K students and no Law school. So far people here
are happy. We are happy (and doing well).

2. Metrics: what do the people who fund us think. The schools vote with their feet
by the amount of money that comes our way. Overall we have been successful in
obtaining funds from schools and from the provost. We also track with ARL. It is my
understanding that we use comparative data carefully to show when we are lagging.
At dept. level we participate in a rigorous strategic planning process that
demonstrates how the library supports university's strategic goals.

3. Metrics: what we end up using are key performance measures — they need to be
reVised annually — they are the basis for our budget requests. We typically put in
gate count, circulation, and instruction stats. But I am not sure they tell the right
story. " I have never been satisﬁed with the measures we use." Who knows if what
was taught in an instruction session makes a difference in a student's life in the long
term. Do the schools use metrics that mention/refer to the library? Work closely
with office of inst. Research in terms of getting data and adding data points to their
surveys.

4. Metrics: I don't like numbers. The ARL stats don't show your impact and don't
give you any qualitative information. Instead we use Libanalytics that does counts of
various kinds, and describe and rate the difﬁculty of questions answered. It can't
answer for example what we have done for faculty and break it down. Need to have
a better way to describe our successes; context is key to understanding the

186

numbers. For the 4 indicators (as related to the strategic plan) we provide numbers
of sessions course related or course integrated, for example. Money spent on
collections, etc.

5. Metrics: it really varies: the experience of faculty and students; for me: how much
money did we raise and how did that make us stronger. Use of the library is key of
course.

6. Metrics: don't think we do that well. Don't have good accountability measures.

7. Metrics: the continued funding for the library and its programs

8. Metrics: we track transactions, borrow direct and other counts, but to my mind
they don't tell the story. There are micro cultures in the library and each have their

own way of measuring success. CEO asks TMT to send him 'successes' at the end of
the year. Though, there doesn't seem to be agreement on what that looks like."

APPENDIX 7.
Satisfaction and Inﬂuence

TMT members were asked to rate on a scale of 1-5 (1: not satisfied, 5=Very
satisfied) their level of satisfaction with the outcome of the two strategic decisions
they cited. A follow-up questionnaire sent to participants asked them to rate
themselves on a scale of 1-7 (1=no inﬂuence, 7=much inﬂuence) regarding the level
of inﬂuence they felt they had had on a particular decision. Responses to these
questions are found below organized by public and private institutions. An
annotation in bold indicates that a TMT member cited one or more issues in
common with the CEO, was hired by or promoted into his/her position by the CEO,
indicated a high level of satisfaction with the outcome of the decision, and indicated
they had a high degree ofinﬂuence on the final decision for the issue cited in
common with the CEO)

Satisfaction with outcome and inﬂuence are two important factors that together are
indicative of engagement with an issue. High satisfaction indicates a favorable
outcome to the decision. A high inﬂuence indicator coupled with a high satisfaction
rating offers further evidence of TMT member involvement in strategic decision-
making. It is of note that in all three public institutions, there is one TMT member
who cited the same issue (s) as the CEO, was promoted or hired by that CEO, and
ranked their degree of satisfaction and their perceived degree of inﬂuence as high.
In each of these cases the CEO independently ranked the TMT member's inﬂuence as
high as well. By contrast, only one out of three private institutions in the study
presented the same conditions. Of note is that the one institution that did present
the same findings, had three TMT members who cited the same issue as the CEO,
who were hired or promoted by that CEO and recorded high levels of satisfaction
with the outcome of the decision and their inﬂuence on the decision. The CEO again
conﬁrmed the TMT member's high level of inﬂuence.
